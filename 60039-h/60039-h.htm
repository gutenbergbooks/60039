<h2><a name="TO_THE_READER" id="TO_THE_READER"><i>TO THE READER</i></a></h2>
<p>The erection by the Canadian public
    of a monument in the capital of the
    Dominion; its unveiling by the representative
    of the Crown; its acceptance, on
    behalf of the government, by the Prime
    Minister of Canada; a gathering of thousands
    to do honour to the occasion,&mdash;and
    this, to commemorate the heroism of one
    not yet eight and twenty years of age,&mdash;is a
    national tribute which may well cause us to
    pause and silently revere a people who in
    their hearts cherish so strong a love for the
    heroic, and build for their children such
    sacred traditions.</p>
<p>It is now four years since Henry Albert
    Harper, in an endeavour to save the life of
    Miss Bessie Blair, a girl of rare and beautiful
    character, was drowned with her in the
    Ottawa River. On an afternoon in December,
    1901, he had joined, by chance, a party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> of three, of which Miss Blair was a member.
    They were skating on the river, a little before
    twilight, when Miss Blair and a gentleman
    who accompanied her, came suddenly
    upon a wide space of open water near the
    mouth of the Gatineau. Before there was
    time to avoid it, they had skated into the
    opening, and were at the mercy of the current.
    Harper, who was following at a short
    distance with a friend of Miss Blair, witnessed
    the accident and went at once to their assistance.
    Having sent the young lady with
    whom he was skating to the shore for help,
    he himself lay prone upon the ice, close to
    the edge, and extending his walking stick,
    endeavoured to put it within reach of those
    in the water. Finding the distance too great,
    and hearing Miss Blair assuring her companion
    that she could swim alone, for each
    to make a single attempt lest they should go
    down together, and seeing also that he was
    striving in vain to save her, Harper regained
    his feet, pulled off his coat and gauntlets, and
    prepared to risk his life in an endeavour to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> effect a rescue. In answer to entreaties not
    to make the venture, that it meant certain
    death, he exclaimed, &ldquo;What else can I do!&rdquo;
    and plunged boldly into the icy current in
    the direction of Miss Blair. They perished
    together; their bodies were found on the
    following morning, the one not far from the
    other. Miss Blair&rsquo;s companion had a miraculous
    escape, otherwise no one would have
    known of the brave deed which has given
    Harper an enviable fame, and of the no less
    splendid courage of Miss Blair. She, as well
    as Harper, was prepared to give her life for
    another.</p>
<p>At a largely attended public meeting, held
    in the city hall of Ottawa a day or two after
    the occurrence, and which was presided over
    by the mayor, resolutions were passed inviting
    the public to join in the erection of a
    monument to commemorate Harper&rsquo;s heroism.
    It was decided that the monument
    should be of bronze or stone, to be erected in
    the open air, and to take the form of a figure
    symbolical of heroism and nobility of char<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>acter,
    such as might be suggested by the
    figure of &ldquo;Sir Galahad,&rdquo; in the famous painting
    of that name by the late George Frederick
    Watts, R. A. The choice of a sculptor was
    to be determined by a public competition,
    unrestricted in any way.</p>
<p>The character of Harper&rsquo;s act was sufficient
    in itself to suggest &ldquo;Sir Galahad&rdquo; as a subject
    suitable for a memorial of this kind, but
    the choice had, in fact, a more intimate association
    with Harper himself. Hanging on
    the wall above the desk in his study, and
    immediately before him whenever he sat
    down to work, was a carbon reproduction of
    Watts&rsquo; painting. He had placed it there
    himself, and often, in speaking of it to others,
    had remarked, &ldquo;There is my ideal knight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the design and model submitted to the
    memorial committee by Mr. Ernest Wise
    Keyser, the best expression appeared to be
    given to the ideal which it was hoped might
    be embodied in the monument to be erected.
    Mr. Keyser is a young American sculptor, a
    citizen of Baltimore, Maryland, who had his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> studio in Paris at the time. Subsequent to
    the making of the award it was learned that
    he had been born on the same day of the same
    year on which Harper was born. He was
    commissioned to execute the work. A beautiful
    bronze &ldquo;Sir Galahad,&rdquo; mounted on a
    massive granite base, deep carved in which
    are Sir Galahad&rsquo;s words in the <i>Holy Grail</i>,</p>

</div>
<p class="pn">the whole standing within the shadow of the
    stately pile which crowns Parliament Hill,
    marks the successful completion of the sculptor&rsquo;s
    task.</p>
<p>The monument was unveiled by His Excellency
    Earl Grey, Governor-General of
    Canada on the afternoon of Saturday, 18th
    November, 1905. A fitting impressiveness
    marked the unveiling ceremonies. Notwithstanding
    that so long a time had elapsed
    since the deed it commemorated, and that
    the approach of winter was already evident
    in the cold air and in the presence of snow
    upon the ground, three thousand or more of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> the citizens of Ottawa assembled in the open
    to do honour to the occasion. Mr. P. D.
    Ross, the chairman of the memorial committee,
    presided, and the Right Honourable
    Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the Prime Minister of
    Canada, accepted the monument on behalf
    of the government. The writer had the
    honour, on behalf of the memorial committee,
    of presenting the monument to Sir
    Wilfrid. The eloquent tributes paid to the
    memory of Harper by the chairman of the
    committee, and by the distinguished representatives
    of the king and of the people at the
    unveiling, were regarded by those who heard
    them as a memorial not less splendid than
    the monument which occasioned the reference.
    The chairman, Mr. Ross, gave expression,
    in the following words, to the feelings
    which had prompted the public in the
    erection of the monument:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;Harper lost his life. But in that sacrifice he
        left to the rest of us a great lesson and a great
        inspiration. Every fellow Canadian of Henry
        Harper was honoured by his death, and every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> man of the English-speaking race from which he
        sprang. It was an assurance that in this country
        there is present the old manly virtue, the true
        steel of our forefathers. And, far more than that,
        it was one argument more that our human nature
        has in it inspiration and strength from a higher
        than earthly source.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Had such a thing gone uncommemorated by
        us, his fellow citizens, it would have been a disgrace
        to us. The absence of this memorial, or
        of some memorial, would have marked our blindness,
        our meanness. Harper did not need this
        monument. We did. Such heroic fire as his
        commemorates itself. But we fellow Canadians
        of Henry Harper needed to show by practical
        action that we could see and reverence the nobility
        of soul which sent him knowingly to his
        grim death.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The Right Honourable Sir Wilfrid Laurier,
    in accepting the monument on behalf of the
    government, spoke as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;Let me say, sir, in accepting this monument,
        commemorating, as it does, an heroic death, that
        the government of Canada looks upon its acceptance
        as an honour, and will consider it a labour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> of love to care for it. I enter heartily into the
        spirit which conceived the idea of this splendid
        testimonial to a glorious deed. Harper&rsquo;s act of
        heroism will ever be an example and a lesson to
        us all. The stranger to our city will pause as he
        passes this monument and wonder what deed
        called forth its erection. He will be told of the
        noble act of self-sacrifice&mdash;of a life given in an effort
        to save another. The citizens of Ottawa will
        ever be proud to honour the memory of Harper,
        and to look, as the government shall look, upon
        this memorial as a national monument in every
        sense of the word.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>His Excellency the governor-general, said:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;I would like to extend my congratulations on
        the notable addition of this monument to the interest,
        embellishment and idealism of this Federal
        city. Although I never knew Harper, I have
        learned enough about him to believe that I shall
        seldom pass this monument without being reminded
        of the example which he has bequeathed
        as a precious legacy. His character and ability
        were such as would have enabled him, had he
        lived, to win in the wide and honourable service
        of the Crown that distinction which is within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> reach of all whose greatest delight is to spend
        themselves, their fortunes and their lives in the
        service of their fellow countrymen and their King.
        He is gone, but who shall say that Canada and
        the world are not richer by his death? His character
        and his example live. I congratulate the
        sculptor on the skill with which this statue of Sir
        Galahad indicates those qualities of energy, fearlessness
        and service of which young Harper was
        the incarnation; and I hope this statue may be
        only the first of a set of noble companions which,
        in the course of time, will make this street the <i>Via Sacra</i> of the capital.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;A few years ago I stood at the grave side of
        another young civil servant of the Crown in the
        Matoppos of Rhodesia, who, as he was carried to
        his last resting place mortally wounded, said:
        &lsquo;Well, it is a grand thing to die for the expansion
        of the Empire&rsquo;&mdash;that Empire which, in his mind, as
        in that of Harper, was synonymous with the cause
        of righteousness. Harper and Hervey, had they
        known each other, would have been bosom friends;
        they both believed in their idea. If they had
        lived they both would have done great things.
        They have both died, and how would they have
        died better?&mdash;for their ideas will not die; no,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> neither in the Matoppos, nor on the banks of the
        Ottawa, nor in any other portion of the British
        empire, so long as we are loyal to their traditions
        and follow their example.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The regimental band of the Governor-General&rsquo;s
    Footguards, which had volunteered its
    services, played &ldquo;The Maple Leaf&rdquo; as the
    King&rsquo;s representative unveiled the monument;
    at the same moment the sun came out from
    behind a cloud. The ceremonies were concluded
    with the national anthem.</p>

<p>It was the writer&rsquo;s privilege to have been

    has seemed to him that he would be unworthy
    of a friendship such as existed between
    them, were he unwilling to share with others
    some of the beauty of soul which he knew so
    well, and of which Harper&rsquo;s heroic deed was
    but an expression. For personal reasons, he
    has, up to the present, hesitated to disclose
    aught that has been in his keeping. The
    generous appreciation by the public of a
    single act appears to him now to warrant a
    larger confidence. He has ventured, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>fore,
    to allow those who will, to look in at the
    windows of the soul, and see, in its sacred
    chambers, the secret which was an abiding
    presence in a life whose heroism has already
    received from the nation a recognition so
    splendid and impressive.</p>
<p>To those into whose hands this little volume
    may come, the writer begs they forget
    not that it is but a collection of fragments
    gathered, after he had gone, from along the
    path on which he trod. It is not Harper&rsquo;s
    life, it is not even a worthy tribute to his
    character. What it may contain of thoughts
    and expressions of his own will be acceptable
    as &ldquo;broken light upon the depth of the unspoken&rdquo;;
    for the rest it will be well, if, as
    a labour of love, it has done no injustice to
    the memory of a friend.</p>

<p>The quality of a man&rsquo;s love will determine
    the nature of his deeds; occasion
    may present the opportunity,
    but character alone will record the experience.
    To a life given over to the pursuit of the
    beautiful and true, the immortal hour only
    comes when conduct at last rises to the level
    of aim, and the ideal finds its fulfilment in
    the realm of the actual. &ldquo;Greater love hath
    no man than this, that a man lay down his
    life for his friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Few lives have been more earnest or constant
    in the pursuit of an ultimate perfection
    than was Henry Albert Harper&rsquo;s; few
    have sought more conscientiously than he
    to live out existence under the guidance of
    lofty aspirations, and in the light of pure
    ideals. There was nothing exceptional, save
    the opportunity, in the chivalrous act which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> cost him his life. It was a sublime expression
    of the hidden beauty of his real character
    and soul. Day by day he had been seeking
    for years to gain that freedom which is the
    reward of obedience to the highest laws of
    life, and little by little he had been fashioning
    a character unfettered and untrammelled by
    human weaknesses and prejudices, and strong
    in the noblest qualities of heart and mind.
    Galahad cried, &ldquo;<i>If I lose myself, I save myself!</i>&rdquo;
    In the same spirit, and with the same
    insight into truth, Harper sought to keep
    unbroken the vision of immortality which
    was his, to be faithful to an ideal of duty,
    which, by a seeming loss, he has made incarnate
    for all time.</p>
<p>By what path the heroic was attained in
    Harper&rsquo;s life may be traced from the pages
    of a diary, in which at intervals he recorded
    his thoughts, and from the words he has left
    in letters to his friends. Fragmentary as
    these are, an attempt has been made in the
    following pages to weave from them the story
    of his inner life, in the belief that its beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> will bring courage and inspiration to many,
    and in the knowledge that there is something
    of inestimable worth in a recorded experience
    which reveals the endeavour of a human soul
    to know and attain the highest, and to realize
    its divine capacities amid the complexities of
    every-day life.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_INFLUENCE_OF_HOME" id="THE_INFLUENCE_OF_HOME"><i>THE INFLUENCE OF HOME</i></a></h2>
<p>Harper was born in the village of
    Cookstown, Ontario, on December
    9, 1873, but most of his childhood
    was spent at Barrie, one of the most picturesque
    and beautifully situated of Canadian
    inland towns. The vine-clad lattice alone
    obstructed the beautiful view from the front
    veranda of his father&rsquo;s house across the waters
    of Kempenfeldt Bay, and it was to this home
    and its associations that he was wont to attribute
    all that was best in his nature and
    dearest in his affections. It was there that
    the great joys and the great sorrows of his
    short life had centred. It was over this Barrie
    home that the skies were the brightest to
    him; and it was there, too, that for a time
    the clouds had appeared to return after the
    rain.</p>
<p>There are few pages anywhere which, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> simpler or more tender words, disclose a
    heart&rsquo;s love and sorrow, a life&rsquo;s greatest inspiration
    and its greatest grief, than those
    which commence Harper&rsquo;s diary after it
    had remained closed for nearly three years.
    They constitute an expression of feeling so
    personal, a record so sacredly tender, that
    their publication can be justified only on
    the ground that they are among the few
    passages he has left which reveal the influence
    of his home upon his life, an influence
    which, as the words themselves show, was
    the strongest and the sweetest he had known.
    Just a year before his death, Harper writes:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;For nearly three years this book has travelled
        around with me unopened&mdash;three years in which
        I seem to have lived a lifetime. They have been
        filled with satisfaction enough in some ways, and
        with pain enough, too. Seven months ago, when
        the world seemed empty, I was inclined to throw
        myself upon these pages, but my feelings were
        too much my own, even for that, for, since I last
        wrote here, I have gazed into the darkest depths.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Though &lsquo;out in the world&rsquo; in a measure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> since I left home for college, the little home group
        in Barrie remained the centre of my world. The
        chief reward of success was the &lsquo;well done&rsquo; from
        the kindest father and most loving mother who
        ever lived. They have gone. After a week&rsquo;s
        illness father died on April 6, 1900. Mother
        joined him on April 12th. During thirty-six
        years of married life they had been loyal and
        true to each other, and to their duty before God
        and man. For their children they sacrificed
        personal comfort and social pleasures. Loving
        sympathy always went out to meet us in joy or
        in pain. They passed away together into the
        hereafter with unflinching eye, and with a nobleness
        and truth of heart which won them the respect
        of all good men and women who knew them
        in life.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I did not reach home until the morning of
        father&rsquo;s death, and when I saw that dear beloved
        face it wore the calmness and pallor of death.
        That room in which he lay is hallowed. To the
        last, they say, his carelessness of self was evident.
        A frank, straightforward man; his life open as a
        book; his heart kind, with the true love of a
        Christian. He was not particularly demonstrative,
        but we all knew the breadth and depth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span> his affection and his sympathy. At the end, conscious
        of it, he gazed before him towards the face
        of God, as one ready to appear before the judgment
        seat. A healthy, honest, wholesome man,
        he was to me father, brother and friend.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;And my mother. How often has her clinging
        kiss muttered a prayer as I left home, and
        impressed a welcome as I returned. An heroic
        character, enriched by the depth of a mother&rsquo;s
        love, was hers. When I reached home on that
        cold, gray day in early spring, she lay there sorely
        stricken with the dread pneumonia which had
        taken my father, but patient, tender, unselfish as
        ever. To my broken attempt at encouragement,
        she replied: &lsquo;Yes, I must try and live for you
        children.&rsquo; But, as life ebbed and she saw that it
        was not to be, that noble heart, ever resigned to
        the will of God, accepted the inevitable. It
        seemed that to join him who had gone was her
        dearest wish; without him life, as she lay there
        suffering, must have seemed cold, empty, cheerless.
        But even this she seemed prepared to bear,
        so that she might keep a home open for her children,
        and endeavour to help them from falling
        from the path of duty. Then came the day when
        she was told that hope of recovery was gone. &lsquo;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> knew it,&rsquo; she said. Calling us around her, in a
        voice greatly weakened, she uttered her heart&rsquo;s
        wish in a simple sentence&mdash;&lsquo;I want you all to be
        good, so that you may meet us There.&rsquo; I am
        naturally rather disposed to be cold, I fear, but in
        that moment the depth of that mother&rsquo;s love
        came to me as never before, and the sublimity of
        her faith burst upon me. From that day dates
        a new epoch in my life.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;To the last her thoughts were of us. Faithfully,
        unobtrusively, but unswervingly, she had
        throughout life worked and lived that we might
        know truth, and not stray from what she was wont
        to call &lsquo;the straight and narrow path.&rsquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;At four o&rsquo;clock in the morning the end came.
        How cold the dawn of that morning! Without a
        struggle her soul went to its God. How delicate
        the thread which binds us to eternity! But a
        short time before she was there and knew all that
        was happening; that she was going; and, that
        we must fight the battle of life, with the snares
        and temptations with which we are beset by our
        human passions and weaknesses. Not a doubt
        seemed to enter into that mind, which had held
        steadfastly to the eternal truth throughout a noble,
        fearless life. She had run her race, she had kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> the faith. The sturdy integrity, inherited from
        her father, and a gentle, loving kindness, which
        probably came from the mother who died when
        she was yet a child, combined to make a character
        which by its sweetness, beauty and nobility, has
        woven itself into my life. Pray God that I may
        never be unworthy of her memory.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And unworthy of so holy a memory Harper
    never was. While spared to him, the love
    and affection of his father and mother were
    his greatest inspiration, and his great reward;
    taken from him, the remembrance of their
    example, and a belief in their continued existence,
    constituted an abiding presence, helping
    him ever to nobler conduct and aim.</p>
<p>Yet, how irreparable this loss was, words
    cannot tell. Harper could never bring himself
    to speak of it without the deepest emotion.
    What seemed hardest to him was that
    his father and mother should have been taken
    just when he had hoped to be able to make
    them fully conscious of his gratitude.</p>
<p>In a letter written some months after, he
    says:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;Great as is my pride in the noble lives of my
        beloved parents, and confident as I am that they
        will enjoy their reward unto all eternity, I find it
        impossible to get away from the sense of the emptiness
        of the world without them. Their lives
        were devoted to their children, and their children
        were devoted to them. A kinder father, and a
        more loving mother, never lived. To them we
        looked for congratulation upon any success which
        fell to our lot and for sympathy if our sky were
        dark. They never failed us. And at the moment
        when we were all comfortably settled in our
        professions, and there was the prospect of a long
        peaceful life before them, they were taken away.
        Herein lies the chief bitterness of it all. But we
        have the lesson of their lives, and fond memories
        which we can ever cherish.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Some time later, in acknowledging hospitality
    shown him during a brief visit in Toronto,
    he wrote on his return to Ottawa:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;As I lay in my berth last night, looking out
        at the beautiful, silent, star sprinkled sky, a feeling
        settled upon me that the curtain had just
        fallen upon one of the happiest days of my life.
        The warmth of your welcome, and the kindly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> thoughtfulness of your every word and action,
        were appreciated by me the more, because I have
        learned what it is, both to have, and to be without,
        that most happy and most sacred of human
        associations, a home.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>There is less of intensity of grief, but
    hardly less of tenderness and delicacy of feeling,
    in his words of sympathy with a friend,
    which, containing an expression of his own
    belief, also reveal the continued influence of
    his home and its associations on his daily
    actions, even after these associations had
    vastly changed. In a letter written only a
    few months before his death, during a short
    visit to Barrie, the last which he spent amid
    the scenes of his youth, he says:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;And furthermore, I know that you understand
        that when sorrow crosses your path, your
        sorrow is mine just as is your happiness. I know
        the wrenching of the heart-strings which comes
        when one who is close is taken away, and I feel
        deeply with you. I can only repeat to you the
        message which you sent to me when all that I
        held dearest on earth seemed to have passed out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> of it. There is no death. Life is eternal and
        makes towards perfection. When those whom we
        love pass, we are the more linked to that greater,
        larger, deeper spiritual life which is within us and
        about us, but which passes our human comprehension.
        The very air in which I write is filled
        with a thousand associations which bring me into
        the closest sympathy with those who have passed
        through the Valley of the Shadow. Were you
        here to-night, I might make myself intelligible in
        a way which I cannot hope to in a letter. As I
        have been sitting here looking out over the bay
        with which I am so familiar, my boyhood and my
        youth have passed before me, and these, as well
        as the hopes and aspirations of early manhood,
        are so closely associated with the devoted lives
        which guarded and nourished all that was good in
        me, that I could not recognize myself, were I
        not convinced of their continued existence and
        their living interest in all that I cherish that is
        worthy. This afternoon I stood before the grate
        where, with you, I spent an hour which stands
        out as a milestone in my life, and to-night I thank
        God that we have been enabled to accomplish
        something of what we then contemplated, and
        that we have before us opportunity of usefulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> beyond what we could have imagined as we stood
        there upon the threshold of life. The very atmosphere
        of this dear old place is sacred to me
        through the associations which float through my
        mind as I breathe it. My visit here has been like
        a pause in a quiet and familiar eddy in the stream
        of life, and I feel that it has done me good. It
        has strengthened me in my resolutions, and has
        enabled me to see more clearly.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It is rarely, if ever, that men, especially
    young men, stop to estimate the influences
    which are the most potent in their lives, and
    it is rarer still, in seeking this estimate, that
    they become conscious, with any true degree
    of proportion, of the extent to which home,
    as compared with other influences, has contributed
    to the result. It was not so with
    Harper. He honoured his father and his
    mother, and he was wont to attribute to what
    he inherited by birth, by training, and by example
    from them, all that made for what was
    worthiest and best in his life.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="COLLEGE_AND_AFTER" id="COLLEGE_AND_AFTER"><i>COLLEGE AND AFTER</i></a></h2>
<p>Colleges and universities afford the
    opportunity for the attainment of a
    measure of self-knowledge, self-reliance
    and self-development, which in the
    home is often apt to come too slowly, and,
    learned at first hand with the world, is bought
    frequently at the price of an experience which
    dwarfs, if it does not altogether destroy, some
    of the finer fruits of those essential qualities
    of manhood. It is not what is gained in
    knowledge of books, but in knowledge of
    self, of limitations and powers and capacities;
    in what is acquired of habits of self-discipline
    and application, of methods of thought and
    research, that a college or university renders
    its truest service to its students; as it is by
    the love of truth and learning which it instils,
    rather than by the honours and degrees
    which it confers, that a university puts its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> stamp upon the graduates it sends out into
    the world.</p>
<p>It may be that for many men four years of
    undergraduate life are not sufficient to make
    a college impress deep, or, to appearances,
    lasting; but if in any measure it is real, that
    influence must tell, not only on the years immediately
    succeeding, but through the whole
    of life. The first fruits of a college education
    are more likely to be revealed in the attitude
    of mind towards the problems of life, as these
    present themselves when academic halls are
    vacated, than in any immediate accomplishment.
    A consciousness of capacity without
    opportunity may be, and is too often, the first
    inheritance of many a man, whose intellect
    has been stimulated and whose zeal has been
    intensified by association with his fellows in
    the numerous relationships which undergraduate
    life affords, but who finds in the
    world a less ordered and less congenial
    arrangement. Probably for most men, the
    years immediately following the attainment
    of their academic or professional degrees are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> the most critical, if not also the most painful,
    years of their lives.</p>
<p>To this phase of post-graduate experience
    Harper&rsquo;s life was no exception, though undergraduate
    days were enjoyed by him to
    the full. In the summer of 1891, at the age
    of seventeen, he matriculated at the University
    of Toronto, from the Barrie Collegiate
    Institute, and he graduated from the university
    in June, 1895. He was, during the last
    three years of his undergraduate course, an
    honour student in the department of Political
    Science, and the class lists show that in the
    work of this department, especially in the
    subjects of political economy and political
    philosophy, he held a high place. His contemporaries
    at the university will always remember
    him as a man who entered in a whole-hearted
    way into what may be spoken of as
    the larger life of the university. He was a
    prominent member of the Literary and Scientific
    Society, and of his class society, and was
    always certain to be found an active participant
    in those events or movements of general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> interest with which undergraduate life at a
    large university abounds. While he was
    fond of books and might have been termed,
    at least during the latter half of each year, a
    conscientious student, it is doubtful if he did
    not get quite as much as, or more, out of association
    with his fellows, and from sharing in
    the spontaneous life of the college, than he
    did from the lecture room. A characteristic
    which distinguished him was a readiness to
    carry on with enthusiasm whatever he undertook,
    and this, combined with a nature intensely
    loyal to cause or friend, made him a
    strong man among men, and one whose support
    was sought because it could be counted
    upon. On the whole his disposition was
    social rather than individual, and his interests
    were diversified rather than particular. He
    was saved from the possible inimical effects
    of such a nature by an earnestness of purpose
    which kept him true to his responsibilities,
    while there can be little doubt that from
    it, in the broadening of his sympathies and in
    the understanding of men and their ways, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> gained much which was of infinite service to
    him in after years.</p>
<p>Measured by the standard of growth already
    hinted at, Harper may be said to have
    left the university with a consciousness that
    he was fitted by talent and inclination for
    work in some branch of the so-called higher
    professions, that it was in connection with the
    general, rather than the more exclusive, interests
    of society that his energies would find
    their freest play, and that not by theories, but
    by men, he could hope to be permanently attracted.
    He had already learned that he was
    capable of serious and sustained effort, and
    likely to find in work a satisfaction of his best
    desires; and he must have known that in his
    nature were possibilities of the noblest expressions
    of disinterested action. It was natural,
    therefore, that having made no definite
    choice of a future profession at the time of
    graduation, and having engaged temporarily
    in agency work which was not to his liking,
    and towards which from the start he had not
    entertained any serious intentions, he should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> have found much that tried his patience severely,
    and at times caused him to experience
    periods of the most genuine depression.
    Fruitless attempts to obtain a start in journalism
    added for a while to his discouragements,
    so that the year and a half which followed
    graduation, though characterized by
    anything other than neglect or indifference,
    and, as a matter of fact, made the occasion of
    an opportunity for increased reading and the
    preparation of a thesis which secured him a
    Master&rsquo;s degree from the university, was
    nevertheless, so far as he could see at the
    time, to be remembered as of adversity rather
    than as of advance. In reality it was a testing
    time, and it served to prove the man.</p>
<p>In the pages of the journal which Harper
    commenced shortly after graduation, it is
    possible to discern the attitude of mind which
    he had towards the problem of life, as he
    thus encountered it upon the threshold. Revealing
    as they do the qualities of inherent
    worth in him who wrote them, these pages
    are deserving of more than passing reference.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> Two characteristics they clearly disclose, a
    fearless integrity of heart and mind, and a disposition
    to philosophize, underlying each of
    which is a constant purpose of self-improvement,
    and a more than accepted belief in a
    definite moral order, and the ultimate triumph
    of right. Unconsciously he summed up the
    whole in the first paragraph he wrote:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;I am writing this record of my thoughts and
        actions in order that I may be better able to understand
        myself; to improve in that wherein I
        find myself wanting, and that some day I may be
        able to look back and find a rule of development
        or perhaps of life, with its assistance. I shall endeavour
        to be at least honest with myself, and
        hope that the use of this book may help me
        occasionally, to sever myself mentally from the
        associations of the world and retire within myself.
        My hope is that some day I may be able to
        become acquainted with my own individuality,
        and discover what is the first essential and object
        of my existence.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I have not as yet settled upon a course in
        life. Several weapons lie before me which might
        be of use in the conflict with the world, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> all of which I feel that I might soon familiarize
        myself. Which will enable me to achieve the
        greatest success? And by what standard shall I
        measure that success so as to discover whether it
        is real and after all worth striving for? Shall it
        be law, the ministry, a business career, or journalism,
        or what? At one time I lean in one direction,
        and again in another. The result is an unsettled
        frame of mind which cannot be healthy,
        and which compels me to be constantly before
        the bar of my own judgment. I find that the old
        idea of &lsquo;individual aptitude&rsquo; means less than I
        formerly believed. One finds many specialized
        avocations before one, and it is a question of fashioning
        one&rsquo;s self to suit one of them. Whether it
        be that the chosen profession does not employ
        all one&rsquo;s faculties, or requires more than one possesses,
        a certain amount of dissatisfaction is, I
        think, bound to result. It is necessary that a
        man be a philosopher, as well as a lawyer,
        or a carpenter, as the case may be, if he is to be
        happy. I flatter myself that I have a fair education
        (although I regret that I have not drawn from
        it as much as I might and should have), and some
        slight knowledge of men and their ways, but my
        choice is limited to those callings which do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> require a considerable initial capital. At the
        moment my leanings are towards journalism as
        most likely to give me self-satisfaction, and to aid
        me in the study of mankind&mdash;man.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And again,</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;As to myself, during the past week or two,
        the spirit of unrest, to which I have referred as
        characteristic of my mind, has been intensified in
        proportion as I have withdrawn myself more and
        more from the insurance business. One thought
        is ever staring me in the face. It is the question
        which has been before me for so long. What are
        you going to do? I shall certainly have to &lsquo;make
        a break&rsquo; before long, since the state of affairs is
        preying upon my mind and upon my ambition
        and self-esteem. To-night we have some friends
        coming in, a minister from the country and his
        wife. They will probably ask me what am I
        going to do? I am sick of that question.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And on the first of January, 1897,</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;For over three months I have not made a
        single entry in this book, and this for the reason
        that I have had little that is hopeful or pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> to write about. I have been in constant dread of
        the effect upon my mind of the forced inactivity
        to which I am subject, for the uncongenial work
        at which I have been plodding away has been of
        little use as an intellectual training. At times,
        encouraged by the appreciation which I have
        been able to give to some of the sublime thoughts
        of master-minds, or by the words of such friends
        as &mdash;&mdash;, I have been quite hopeful as to my
        future usefulness, but on both my thoughts and
        my humours, I can see the fatal traces of repeated
        disappointments. Of course the life that I have
        been living has not been without its advantages.
        Some of many too hastily conceived ideas have
        been swept away, and withal, sympathies have
        been aroused within me which might never have
        come to me under other circumstances. Furthermore,
        the fact that the time when I must enter the
        struggle for existence on my own behalf has been
        postponed, has led me to think less and less of
        the mean dishonest methods which are so generally
        adopted by some of our so-called successful
        men and used as a means of reaching their petty
        successes. The fact that these opinions had been
        forced upon me, may, it is true, prevent me from
        ever being what the world considers a successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span> man, but if the moral stamina is within me I hope
        they will enable me to realize the high ideal of
        my existence.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;But now as to the thoughts which the New
        Year brings with it. Last night as I listened to
        the tolling of the midnight bell at the Church of
        England, as it rang out the old year and rang in
        the new, the future was none too encouraging to
        me. It was with a feeling of bitterness that I
        took out a note-book and wrote the words, &lsquo;January
        1, 1897, and still on the market.&rsquo; But as I
        sit now and gaze into the future, I think I was a
        little unfair. I have been filling a position of usefulness
        to a degree. I do not think I have lost
        in moral force, while I think I have gained in
        knowledge and love of my fellow men; while the
        fact that I have been compelled to drop some
        ideas which I have held has proven to me both
        that my tendency is towards an honest desire for
        truth, and that I have still much to learn. I look
        forward to the coming year with hope, although I
        have still much of the bitter feeling which has
        been preying upon me all year, causing me many
        wakeful nights and forcing me to call out at times
        when the feeling was intensified, that, with Burke,
        mine was a case of &lsquo;<i>Nitor in adversum</i>.&rsquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;One thing more. Although for years my
        mind has had a decidedly sceptical tone in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> matters of religion, I feel that in the past year I
        have come more into sympathy with the work of
        our religious bodies. This is no doubt largely
        due to a sympathy with the ends which they have
        in view, but probably, also, in great measure to
        my growing belief in God, although my idea of
        the Deity is more correctly expressed in the words
        of Matthew Arnold than in some of the accepted
        creeds. For all these things I feel grateful, and
        my greatest hope as I sat in the church during the
        first moments of the New Year was&mdash;my greatest
        hope as I write these words is, that I may have
        the inclination and the power to cut off from my
        life those things which tend to make it less beautiful,
        less good, and less useful, and that, if living
        when the bells toll in the New Year of 1898, I
        may be able to recognize in myself a better, a
        stronger and a purer man.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Though it has been left to others to trace
    through the pages of his diary the rule of development
    and of life therein disclosed, it
    will hardly be said that the first hope expressed
    was denied, and that Harper did not
    realize, even in the brief day he was allowed,
    &ldquo;the first essential and object of his existence.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="THE_DAYS_WORK" id="THE_DAYS_WORK"><i>THE DAY&rsquo;S WORK</i></a></h2>
<p>For some time before opportunity came
    to engage in journalism, Harper had
    quite made up his mind that this was
    the profession which he could follow with
    most satisfaction to himself, and greatest
    good to others, and he sought every means
    to secure a connection with a newspaper in
    one of the cities. &ldquo;It would seem,&rdquo; he writes,
    after some months of searching, &ldquo;that newspaper
    work is like most other things&mdash;it is
    difficult to get a start at. My experience is
    that it is exceptionally so. I have accepted
    the disappointment philosophically, and I am
    trying to make a good use of my time until
    an opening presents itself, and I am keeping
    my eyes open for one.&rdquo; At last, in February
    of 1897, a temporary vacancy on the staff of
    the London <i>Advertiser</i> afforded an opening,
    and though he had promise of employment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> for not more than a few weeks, and knew for
    a certainty that it could not extend beyond a
    month or two at the most, he gladly seized
    the opportunity. There was a chance, at
    least, to test the field and to prove himself.
    He accordingly left Barrie for London to begin
    as a reporter on the <i>Advertiser</i>, and from
    that time, for the remainder of his life, there
    were to be found no moments of &ldquo;forced inactivity,&rdquo;
    or &ldquo;comparative idleness,&rdquo; but the
    whole was one unbroken stretch of the most
    tireless putting forth of energy, the most continuous
    and sustained activity and zeal.</p>
<p>The weeks on the <i>Advertiser</i> were followed
    by a few months on the London <i>News</i>. In
    October, 1897, an opening came on the
    Toronto <i>Mail and Empire</i>, and Harper joined
    the staff of that journal. In London, his
    duties had been those of a general reporter;
    in Toronto, they were at first the same, though
    with larger opportunities. His abilities, however,
    caused him soon to be singled out for
    the larger and more special assignments, and
    in this way he was brought into active touch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span> with two important branches of public affairs.
    As city hall reporter he had to do for a time
    with municipal politics and administration,
    and, as reporter of the proceedings of the
    Legislative Assembly of Ontario, he was
    brought into similar relationship with provincial
    affairs. An appointment on the staff
    of the Montreal <i>Herald</i> in February, 1899,
    gave him the opportunity of still wider experience
    and further advancement. He was
    part of the time the city editor of that daily,
    and part of the time its representative and
    correspondent at Ottawa. Both positions
    afforded him opportunity of a closer intimacy
    with the public affairs of the Dominion, and as,
    throughout his entire connection with the <i>Herald</i>, he was a contributor to its editorial
    columns, he had commenced to help at least
    to shape and direct public opinion in matters
    of national concern.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Department
    of Labour by the Dominion government in
    the summer of 1900, Harper, in November of
    that year, severed his connection with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> <i>Herald</i> to accept the position of associate
    editor of the <i>Labour Gazette</i>. The department
    had just been created as a new department
    of the government, with the <i>Gazette</i> as
    its official journal. Its policy had still to be
    shaped; its usefulness to be proved. It was
    in part the strong bond of friendship existing
    between Harper and his friend, the deputy
    minister of the department, in part the opportunity
    of cooperation in a work undertaken
    primarily on behalf of the industrial
    classes of Canada, and which he believed
    might be made of the greatest service to the
    country as a whole, that caused him to terminate
    his then promising career in outside
    journalism, and to share with his friend the
    fortunes of the civil service in a work to
    which they were both prepared to devote their
    lives. In addition to being engaged on the <i>Gazette</i>, Harper actively cooperated in the
    management and administration of the affairs
    of the department, and acted as the deputy
    minister of the department when the latter
    was absent on official duties elsewhere. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> was acting as deputy minister of labour at
    the time of his death.</p>
<p>During the entire period he was engaged
    in journalism, Harper had not, with the exception
    of a brief vacation of one or two
    weeks, which he devoted in part to work of
    another kind, a single break of any appreciable
    duration in the round of continuous work.
    The time for vacation, with the exception
    mentioned, came, in every instance, just as a
    new affiliation was formed, and new duties,
    instead of a temporary respite from old ones,
    were taken on. It is doubtful, indeed, if so
    continuous a strain could have been so successfully
    borne, had it not been for the period
    of reflection which preceded it, the joy which
    he found in his work, and the purpose which
    he had at heart.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;I start,&rdquo; he wrote, on February 20, a few
        days before his departure from Barrie to London,
        &ldquo;under favourable auspices, and I intend to
        make my time tell for good so far as it is in my
        power. Perhaps after all it has been best for me,
        this year of comparative idleness. It has at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> enabled me to form certain sober views of life,
        which might not have come until too late, had I
        been carried from the first on the crest of fortune&rsquo;s
        wave.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And upon his arrival at London:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;On this, the evening before my first serious
        association with my chosen profession, let me
        register the resolution which I promised in a letter
        to dear old &mdash;&mdash; last Sunday. I hope and
        trust that I may hereafter be able to subdue whatever
        weakness there is in my character, and there
        is much. I am starting here under favourable
        auspices. May I not betray the trust, and may
        I leave this community better for my influence
        during my sojourn in it!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>After little more than a month&rsquo;s experience
    he wrote again as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;I have had no cause to regret my choice of a
        profession. I begin to feel the tremendous power
        wielded by the press in formulating public opinion,
        and am in a position to build up, by reflection
        upon what it is, a conception of what a
        newspaper should be, all of which I trust will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> enable me, when the time comes, to do my share
        in furthering the highest interests of the State and
        mankind in general. I have come to see where
        the dangers which surround the young newspaper
        man lie, and am endeavouring to keep myself free
        from their influence.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Leaving London in October, &rsquo;97, he measured
    his success and services in a few brief
    words:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;My time here has not been lost, and, while I
        have fallen far short of what I might have done,
        still I think that I leave the city rather better
        than worse for my visit.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Measuring development by the opportunity
    which anniversaries afford, he had, after a
    year&rsquo;s experience, reason to feel that progress
    had been made, while at the same time he
    was fully conscious of what remained to be
    done.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;When I look at myself now and what I was
        on March 1, 1897, when I went to London to
        serve my apprenticeship at daily newspaper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> work, I can scarcely recognize the same individual.
        Carelessness, thoughtlessness and love
        of pleasure, I see all along the line; but I feel
        that I have gained more than I have lost, and
        I have learned that the only road to success is
        work, and close, careful study. I have done
        much that I should not have done, I have omitted
        much, very much, that I ought to have done. I
        see it and shall try and do better.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>A year later, the same earnest spirit, realizing
    its limitations, its responsibilities and
    its opportunities, is revealed in a letter written
    from the press gallery of the House of Commons
    at Ottawa. It refers to his newly
    formed connection with the <i>Herald</i>, and is a
    true and characteristic self-estimate and confession.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;Regarding the change&mdash;it is one of great
        moment to me. Here at the very centre of the
        life of the Dominion, I see all about me means
        of acquiring the knowledge and exerting the influence
        which should make my life a useful one,
        and that, I assure you again, is my chief aim. I
        am still a student, of course, and I am made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> conscious of the fact from the character of the
        men with whom I am associated, for they are all
        men of years, experience and force of character.
        I appreciate the fact that I am still in tutelage,
        and the training here I regard simply as preparatory
        to something else&mdash;what that something else
        may be remains to be seen.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;My own rule, latterly, has been to follow
        the course which promises to be best in the long
        run, for, while not neglecting the present, men of
        our years must remember that life is real, and
        that we must arm ourselves for the struggle on
        the hither side of thirty.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Harper was, at the time, twenty-five years
    of age.</p>
<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="NATURE" id="NATURE"><i>NATURE</i></a></h2>
<p>&ldquo;That in companionship with and
    close study of Nature, who &lsquo;neither
    hastens nor rests&rsquo; but unquestioningly
    conforms to the order laid down by
    the Creator, there lies a potent means of enrichment
    of character, and an important
    medium of culture, I am thoroughly convinced.&rdquo;
    From these words of Harper&rsquo;s
    diary we are enabled to gather with what
    degree of insight, and to what purpose, he
    sought the woods and the fields, and the
    freedom of &ldquo;God&rsquo;s out of doors&rdquo; whenever
    opportunity permitted. From his early boyhood,
    few enjoyments brought him the same
    measure of delight as the afternoon excursions
    or camping expeditions which took him
    with other boys, or with his father, across the
    bay at Barrie, to explore the creeks and unfrequented
    spots away from the haunts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> men. When after graduation his temporary
    employment led him for a time into the bleak
    and rugged parts of Northern Ontario, he
    found an enjoyment and source of instruction
    in this first hand contact with primitive
    conditions, which, to his feelings, was the one
    compensation in the pursuit of an otherwise
    uncongenial task. If a friend were visiting
    him at his home in the summer time he was
    not at rest till they were off together with
    horse or stick into the country, or out with
    canoe or boat on the waters of the bay; and
    if it were winter it was still to be out in the
    open, either on skates or in a sleigh, or for
    one of those long tramps through the snow
    so invigorating and health-giving at that
    season of the year. When his work permitted
    a choice being made between the
    country and the city, he chose the former
    as a place of residence, though early rising
    and much journeying were necessitated
    thereby.</p>
<p>The summer of 1901 was spent in this way
    at Kingsmere in the province of Quebec, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> more beautiful spot than which there is not
    to be found along the whole range of the
    Laurentian hills. It is a distance by road of
    twelve miles from the capital, eight of which
    can be covered by rail. Harper&rsquo;s real sense
    of freedom began when, after a day&rsquo;s work
    in town, that eight miles of travelling was at
    an end, and the chance came for a four mile
    walk across fields, through the woods and
    along the country roads, or for a ride upon
    his wheel or by stage. Then came the evenings
    with their glorious sunsets, and the
    walks and talks in the twilight, and then
    night with its unbroken panoply of star-lit
    sky.</p>
<p>It is, perhaps, impossible to convey, save
    to those who have known the experience, any
    conception of what a constant association of
    this kind with Nature really means. It proves,
    to use Harper&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;how beauty,
    grandeur, sublimity and purity in God&rsquo;s
    world, find a ready response in the human
    heart unfettered.&rdquo; Yet it is this perception of
    God, this communion of soul between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> creature and the Creator as He is revealed in
    Nature, that is the conscious or unconscious
    secret of all the refreshment and joy which
    comes from a contact of this kind. Some
    natures are more susceptible to this kind of
    revelation than others. Harper&rsquo;s nature was
    one that could share and did share it to the
    full.</p>
<p>A few paragraphs from his diary may serve
    to show how real was the &ldquo;response&rdquo; of
    which he spoke between the world of nature
    and his own heart, and how sweetly sensitive
    to even the most delicate of impressions, his
    soul became when under this favouring influence.</p>
<p>Having climbed one Sunday morning to
    the top of the mountain at Kingsmere, to
    find after a hard week&rsquo;s work that rest which
    is the truest reward of toil, he gave himself
    up for a little to recording some of the enjoyments
    of the place and the hour. He writes:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;Here I am having church all by myself in
        this majestically beautiful spot. It was a hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> climb, for it is a sweltering morning, but I am
        amply repaid. I had a five minutes&rsquo; conversation
        with a red squirrel on the way up the mountain.
        He was a little nervous at first, but became reassured,
        climbed down the tree trunk until he was
        ten feet from me, and looked me in the face
        steadily as I prattled away to him. The little
        fellow felt like myself, he could not imagine vicious
        intentions in such a place. A delightful
        breeze is making music in the tree-tops, a bird
        with a clear yet sympathetic note, I can&rsquo;t describe
        the note, and I don&rsquo;t know the name of the bird,
        is leading in a medley of wood sounds infinitely
        refreshing after a hard week&rsquo;s work.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;The thought of the past week has caused me
        to look up for a moment to take another glance at
        the capital, which stands out clearly in the bright
        sunshine, though the lines of the buildings are
        softened by a blue white summer haze, sufficiently
        marked to give the effect of distance. If men
        could only get to a mountain occasionally and
        look down upon the world in which they live and
        move and have their being, there would be less
        dilettantism, less worship of forms, institutions,
        baubles and lath and plaster. The foot-hills,
        when last I saw them from here, were rich in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> full colour of maturity. To-day they are strong
        in the deep refreshing green of youth. They are
        happy. Everything about me is happy, and I
        thank God for it all.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Recording the events of a day on a short
    trip taken in the spring of the year to the
    city of Quebec and points of interest in that
    vicinity, he writes:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;This day was easily the best of our trip. In
        a few minutes we were away from civilization,
        and started our climb, with the assistance of two
        locomotives, up the mountains. At every turn
        some new beauty burst upon us. First, it was a
        cloud capped range of hills, then a quaint whitewashed
        village, then a laughing mountain stream,
        then a tree-encircled, hill-girt lake, then a rushing
        river, then a quiet wood, then a deep shadowy
        valley, then a burst of sun on the new-leafed
        trees, until one felt one&rsquo;s self getting away forever
        from the pettiness of the world. Shortly after
        midday we swung across the bridge at Grand&rsquo;
        Mère, and had a capital view of the falls which
        have been turned to practical use by the Laurentide
        Pulp Company, and, about three o&rsquo;clock, ar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>rived
        at Shawenegan Falls, our objective point.
        We lunched at the Cascade Inn, a picturesque
        summer hotel on a hilltop, and, guided by a staff
        of engineers, visited the works of the Shawenegan
        Falls Power Company which I found extremely
        interesting. All this was as nothing, however,
        compared with the marvellous scene which burst
        upon us when we turned a spur of the hill and
        came out at the foot of the roaring, raging cataract.
        Down a steep, narrow, boulder-strewn
        gorge, rushed the mighty river, struggling, tumbling,
        roaring, throwing itself into the air, and
        shooting forward in huge mountains of surging
        foam or clouds of sunlit spray. I could feel my
        breast heave in sympathy with the great struggle
        that was going forward, and my whole being
        kindle with the beauty and power of it all. Nowhere
        have I seen anything that can rival that
        magnificent spectacle. My nature seemed
        touched to its depths, and I found myself in immediate
        sympathy with the Indians who saw in
        these prodigious efforts of Nature, in the presence
        of which man&rsquo;s littleness is so apparent, the manifestations
        of the work of the Great Spirit. As
        we wound our way through the mountains one had
        a feeling that, once stripped of its forest wealth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span> this district would be a lonely wilderness so far as
        practical utility was concerned. As I gazed into
        the raging torrent, I felt that it was worth a whole
        province of desolation to have that grand, sublime,
        soul purging sight. After gazing long and
        earnestly into the mighty maelstrom, I raised my
        eyes to the tree clad mountains around, rich in
        the fresh foliage of spring, and furrowed with
        deep shadowy glens. I felt that the world was
        indeed grand, beautiful, that no man could stand
        where I stood without feeling that he had a soul.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;And as our train wound its way homeward
        towards a sublimely beautiful sunset, behind the
        glorious tumbled-together hills, the scene of loveliness
        was set in my mind and in my heart in deep
        rich tints of crimson and gold. That day was
        one of the happiest in my life. I cannot attempt
        to describe what I saw in words. All I can do is
        to record something of the impression. It was
        soul stirring.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Later in the year Harper visited the Maritime
    Provinces with members of the Canadian
    Press Association on their annual excursion.
    His account of the trip contains much that is
    full of interest, and something in the way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> recorded observation which might surprise
    those who had had the same opportunities, or
    had visited simultaneously these places and
    participated in the same events. Two brief
    paragraphs may suffice to further illustrate
    how he was wont to be influenced by
    scenes of great natural beauty, and in what
    regard, relative to other things, he was accustomed
    to hold them. Speaking of the
    Montmorency Falls he says:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;At the Montmorency Falls we spent a very
        happy hour. We decided to scramble up the
        cliff side, instead of taking the steps. At the top
        we had a splendid view of the falls which impressed
        me differently from any I had seen. The
        volume of the river is not great, but it descends
        from a giddy height, throwing out a great cloud
        of white spray, peaceful and beautiful. To me
        the message it conveyed was of chastity and
        purity, like a beautiful, faithful woman, who had
        gone through the world to a white age, unspotted
        and unstained. The great semicircular basin beneath
        seemed wrought by Nature to give full
        effect to the beautiful work of the Creator.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>
<p>And referring to the evening of the same
    day, after returning to Quebec, he says:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;After dinner &mdash;&mdash; and I gave up a trip to
        a summer theatre for a stroll on the terrace before
        the Château Frontenac. It was a night not soon
        to be forgotten. The moon&rsquo;s rays, softened by a
        faint film of the most delicate of clouds, fell
        quietly about us, and, from the dancing waves
        far below, came the signal bells of steamers and
        the distant calls of boatmen. I can recall few
        nights to rival it. The world seemed more kind,
        and my own work in it more clear and possible,
        as we sat there and gazed into the quiet night,
        which wore an ethereal, fairy-land air about it,
        pure and inspiring. Most of our fellows were off
        &lsquo;seeing&rsquo; the city, but none of them could have
        had half the pleasure that was ours. Few things
        in the world could have been more beautiful than
        that night out there on the terrace, under the
        frowning guns of the hard war citadel, and above
        the moon-bathed waters of the grand old St. Lawrence.
        I felt my heart throb as I thought that
        this noble river was the gateway to Canada, the
        land which gave me birth, and which I am learning
        to love more and more dearly as years
        roll by.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="BOOKS" id="BOOKS"><i>BOOKS</i></a></h2>
<p>In books, as in nature, Harper found
    companionship and instruction, and the
    selection was as carefully made, and the
    appreciation of the beautiful and true as
    keen and delicate, in the one case as in the
    other. It was a distinguishing mark of his
    reading that he chose, for the most part, only
    such works as were likely to be productive
    of intellectual or moral growth; he read little,
    however, for the sake of mere entertainment,
    and he was less inclined to seek recreation
    with a book than in other ways.</p>
<p>At the university his reading was, for the
    most part, of the books prescribed by the
    college curriculum, with supplementary reading
    along the lines it suggested, and some
    slight addition of current fiction and standard
    works in poetry and prose. For a time, after
    entering upon journalism, he gave himself up
    so entirely to its demands that he may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> said to have dropped books altogether, and
    to have substituted for their reading a careful
    perusal of the daily press, and an occasional
    survey of current magazines and other periodicals.
    The habit thus formed remained
    constantly with him, and made him a careful
    observer of events, and well informed on
    the main issues and questions of the day.
    Though he had the mind of a student and a
    scholar, his habits, as has already been hinted,
    were not of the kind which students are popularly
    supposed to have. His temperament
    was versatile, his nature active, he was impatient
    of too detailed or continuous research,
    and was more interested in living men and
    current affairs than in documentary records
    of any kind. Yet he was by no means blind
    to the fact, which unfortunately many public
    men are, that to be of real service to any
    cause, a man&rsquo;s intellectual as well as his
    physical powers must be stimulated and
    strengthened by sustenance of the proper
    sort, and that, except through inborn genius
    of the rarest kind, a man cannot be saved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> from intellectual sterility, unless, to more
    than a limited degree, he familiarizes himself
    with the best thought of the strongest minds.</p>
<p>The books with which Harper sought to
    become most familiar were the works of
    writers whose intellectual preeminence was
    undoubted, and whose main concern, though
    they viewed it from many and frequently different
    standpoints, was the problem of existence,
    the meaning and the duties of life. Of
    this class, Carlyle, Matthew Arnold, Emerson,
    Tennyson, and, among present day writers,
    Hamilton Wright Mabie, were the ones to
    whose works his spare hours were chiefly devoted
    during his last years. It would be
    difficult to know from which of these authors
    he gained the most; that he was strongly
    influenced by all is beyond question, though
    this influence was one rather of clearer definition
    and understanding of his own beliefs and
    convictions, than of conversion to other and
    different views. Of what, as a teacher, literature
    contributed, something may be gleaned
    from the pages containing his views on pres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>ent
    day problems and matters of religion.
    In the present chapter it is of the companionable
    enjoyment derived from this source,
    consciously sought and cultivated as a means
    to the enrichment of life, that it is desired to
    give a sympathetic appreciation.</p>
<p>The winter of 1900-01 was made exceptionally
    profitable through the opportunities
    of reading which many of its evenings and
    Sundays afforded. Harper and his friend
    had lodgings in common, and his diary is
    full of mention of the evenings they spent together
    in company with books, from which
    each in turn read aloud to the other, and
    which were laid aside only that a deeper
    searching of the heart might follow, accompanied
    by pledges of mutual loyalty and resolve,
    long after the embers had burned out
    upon the hearth, and all things were in the
    sacred keeping of the night. Did not the
    personal references which these accounts contain
    preclude their publication, opportunity
    might be given of looking in upon the best
    that this world has to offer, the soul com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>munion
    of friend with friend. One or two
    passages relating to evenings not dissimilar,
    though spent with less intimate friends, will
    suggest, to those who read them, with what
    profit an evening might have been shared
    with him by those who knew and appreciated
    his genuine self aright, and what measure of
    inspiration in turn was accorded to him by
    the conversation and views of others, and by
    the writings of master minds.</p>
<p>Of the chance happening in of a friend, he
    writes:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;I had finished reading Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s
        criticism of Gray when L&mdash;&mdash; came in and spent
        the evening with me. I read Gray&rsquo;s <i>Elegy</i>, <i>The
        Bard</i> and some other extracts, in order to make
        good Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s judgment. Then we
        talked of men of genius and their lives, and
        L&mdash;&mdash; spoke of their unhappiness and want of
        appreciation. I took the ground that this unhappiness
        was often more apparent than real; that
        the greatest happiness in sensation was that of the
        soul satisfaction which must come with the beautiful
        expression of a great truth; that no great
        work came by chance, but rather that the thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> was first real and vital to the artist; that however
        much, humanly, he might feel the want of appreciation
        and physical satisfaction, his pleasure
        must be ecstatic at finding an expression for his
        best self, his inner life.</p>
    <div class="poem">
        <table summary="poem">
            <tr>
                <td><div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>These demand not that the things without them</i><br />

                        </span> </div></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
    <p>&ldquo;Just as theirs is the great happiness, so theirs
        is the great sorrow, for sorrow to be expressed in
        such form must first be appreciated, felt.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;From this we drifted to Kipling and imperialism,
        my contribution being that Kipling was a
        great imperialist, that of those who were urging
        forward the British empire, he was one of the
        most enlightened, one of the most clear seeing;
        that his anxiety for the empire&rsquo;s future was as
        much cosmopolitan as British, having faith in
        the Anglo-Saxon ideal. In support of this latter
        contention I cited the <i>White Man&rsquo;s Burden</i>,
        which I think was primarily designed for the
        American people.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Then to the woes of Ireland and her future.
        I expressed disgust with the methods of such men
        as &mdash;&mdash;, who are trying to fan the flame of
        hatred to England, a flame justly enough started
        by the long years of oppression, but which must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> be smothered if Ireland is to progress, for I
        can see only one way for her healthy development,&mdash;as
        part of the British empire, the great
        civilizing and evangelizing power of the world.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I read some of Moore&rsquo;s poems to illustrate
        my views of the beauty and richness of the Irish
        nature, and its possibilities when fairly treated.
        We closed our evening by reading a passage from <i>Great Books as Life Teachers</i>, in the chapter
        on <i>Ruskin&rsquo;s Seven Lamps of Architecture</i>, to
        show that true liberty consists in obedience to
        law&mdash;true law. &lsquo;Nature loves paradoxes, and
        this is her chiefest paradox&mdash;he who stoops to
        wear the yoke of law becomes the child of liberty,
        while he who will be free from God&rsquo;s law,
        wears a ball and chain through all his years.
        Philosophy reaches its highest fruition in Christ&rsquo;s
        principle, &ldquo;Love is the fulfillment of the law.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Of an evening spent with friends, he says:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;To-night we spent a pleasant evening, enjoying
        music and reading. Mrs. J&mdash;&mdash;, whose
        whole life seems to be poetry and music combined,
        rendered several brilliant selections on the
        piano, conveying to me a conception of beautiful
        thoughts playing about the crests of moonlit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> waves, after which R&mdash;&mdash; and I read several
        of Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s poems. I have grown to
        like Matthew Arnold more and more. His philosophy,
        the pursuit of perfection, of sweetness
        and light, and the sweeping away of viciousness,
        has always influenced me strongly since I first
        read <i>Culture and Anarchy</i> some years ago. But
        I find in him more and more the noble high
        minded man as I proceed. I read <i>The Buried
        Life</i> and <i>Rugby Chapel</i> among other things.
        The latter has always been a favourite of mine,
        pointing, as it does, a noble useful view of human
        duty, as in the lines&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The room where we sat before a grate fire
    seemed filled with the thought of the noble man
    who penned the poem, and the evening was a
    most enjoyable one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harper&rsquo;s was a nature quick to respond
    to the beautiful and true wherever found,
    whether in prose or verse, in music or painting,
    or in the actions of daily life. He was,
    moreover, intensely sympathetic, and what
    he read or saw always impressed, and sometimes
    affected, him deeply. He would often
    rise from the reading of a beautiful poem, or
    the story of some heroic human effort, with
    eyes filled and voice completely overcome,
    and then, as a means of gaining relief, and at
    the same time of giving expression to his
    feelings, would pen in a single sentence or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span> two the thought that was most in his mind at
    the time.</p>
<p>Such little entries as the following are a
    characteristic feature of his diary, and reveal
    his sympathetic appreciation of what he read,
    and of the subject treated:</p>

        illustrating the subduing calm of the woods. Before

        his weakness would have made him detestable.
        But for his weakness his poetical genius might
        have made him one of the most beautiful of all
        our authors. As he is, he is one of those strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span> paradoxes who give rise to speculation as to the

        court, with its noble King, its high ideals and its

        the example of one sin. Another thing which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> struck me was that Tennyson, like others, shows
        that the deadliest enemy is the Judas. The most
        cherished knight and beloved Queen poisoned the
        court by betraying friend and husband. But
        Tennyson holds out the beautiful hope of the
        thief upon the cross. Lancelot was allowed to
        die a holy man; and Guinevere, by true repentance
        and goodly works, was able to purge her
        soul so as to be prepared for the reunion hereafter.
        The gentle teaching of the poem is that
        we must be swayed by high resolves and noble
        motives.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LOVE_OF_OTHERS" id="THE_LOVE_OF_OTHERS"><i>THE LOVE OF OTHERS</i></a></h2>
<p>In love for others human nature manifests
    its highest expression. It is the quality
    of soul by which, in his relations with his
    fellows, a man&rsquo;s capacity for service is determined;
    it is the fount at which all the finer
    springs of action are fed. Generosity, mercy,
    pity, friendship, devotion, sacrifice, flow from
    this one source, which conscious effort may
    help to replenish, but which conscious or unconscious
    borrowing can never exhaust.</p>
<p>In his love for others lay the absorbing
    passion of Harper&rsquo;s life. It was a love which
    begot him the strongest and most enduring
    of friendships, and it was a love which carried
    his influence, and the sweet purpose of
    his life, away out beyond the circles of those
    with whom he was in daily association to
    where the tide of affection is wont to ebb,
    or, apparently, wastes itself in the reefs and
    shallows which abound. Man, woman, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> child, he felt their kinship to the race; their
    lives were related to his life; misfortune only
    heightened his sympathy, and failure his
    compassion. Day after day gave new expression
    to the wealth of generous purpose
    in that great human heart of his. It dictated
    the fields into which he directed his activities;
    it inspired his impulses, and was the sustaining
    power in his work.</p>
<p>Nor was this, with Harper, a blind love, an
    unreasoned passion. On the contrary, whatever
    its origin, it derived its strength from a
    carefully thought out philosophy of life, a
    philosophy based on a belief in a divine order
    and purpose in the universe, and in the
    sanctity of individual lives. He had faith in
    both God and man, and he held that the will
    of the one could only be fulfilled as it was
    realized in the life of the other. This belief
    explains his efforts on behalf of individuals,
    it interprets the views he held on such questions
    as those of social and political reform.</p>
<p>He loved men because of the belief he had
    in their natures. &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> is not the external appearance of a man, nor
    what he says or does, that ought to excite
    our admiration or distrust, but that inner
    personality, the individuality, the soul, which
    is &lsquo;the all and in all,&rsquo; and of which appearances
    are but imperfect representations and
    expressions.&rdquo; He was not a man given to
    professions, or to the public performance of
    good deeds; in fact, the being seen of men
    caused him to hesitate in the doing of much
    which a less sensitive nature would have allowed.
    He did not shrink, however, from
    manifesting a personal interest in lives which
    seemed to demand it of him, or from revealing
    his purpose to those whom he knew
    could appreciate it aright.</p>
<p>One incident, among two or three which
    he has recorded, but one of a great many
    known only to those with whom the occasion
    was shared, is sufficient to illustrate how
    practical expression was given to this belief.
    It occurred within a short time after he had
    left the university, and before he had entered
    upon his journalistic career.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;I was returning home one night after a social
        evening, when I saw a young man in the hands
        of a policeman. He was what some people would
        have called a &lsquo;bad boy,&rsquo; kept rather doubtful
        company, and was under arrest for having raised
        a disturbance during a drunken row. Well, I
        managed to get the boy, who was about eighteen
        years of age, out of the cells on bail, and, in
        company with a fellow who had been &lsquo;painting
        the town&rsquo; with him, I undertook to take him
        home. I contrived, after some time, to get rid
        of his &lsquo;pal,&rsquo; and, as soon as the boy was sober
        enough, I undertook to find out whether he had
        a conscience.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;After walking about the streets with him for
        a couple of hours in the beautiful moonlight, by
        the aid of a power which was certainly not my
        own, I discovered that he had; and the boy
        opened up his heart to me. I showed him the
        uselessness and folly of the life into which he was
        rapidly drifting, and, in a voice convulsed with
        sobs, he told me that what I said was true. My
        own eyes moistened as he confessed what a fool he
        was. He concluded by promising me in a voice
        and with a pressure of the hand which meant
        truth, that he would never touch a drop of liquor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> again. From the frank manner in which he
        meets my eyes when I now see him occasionally,
        I believe that he has thoroughly reformed. That
        night, as I went home, I knew that one prayer had
        not been in vain.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>For society as a whole, as for its individual
    members, his aim was a constant betterment.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;There are so few men who couple the capacity
        for appreciating the troubles of struggling humanity
        with an earnest desire to remove them,
        that I can see in such a life a tremendous power
        for good, and, after all, is not that the highest
        ideal a man can hold before him?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In this sentence, penned in reference to
    another, he wrote of himself more truly
    than he knew. His journals are full of
    passages which disclose his &ldquo;capacity to
    appreciate,&rdquo; and his &ldquo;earnest desire to remove,&rdquo;
    the obstacles which thwart the upward
    and onward progress of men engaged
    in the competitive rivalries of the world, and
    in the struggle for daily bread. Whether it
    was pursuing an uncongenial task in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> wilds of Muskoka, or immersed in the cares
    and unrest of journalism, or busied in research
    for material from which to construct
    an article for the <i>Labour Gazette</i>, a human
    interest in the life and the lot of the mass of
    men was ever before him, and a purpose to
    understand and improve that lot his aim.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;During the course of my stay here,&rdquo; he
        writes of Muskoka, in the winter of 1895, &ldquo;I
        have had some chance to notice the type of
        inhabitants of this inhospitable district. First
        and foremost come the lumbermen, not the
        miners who live in the town, but the stout fellows
        in smock and jersey, with their pants shoved into
        stockings, which are in turn encased in stout rubbers.
        Overcoats are scarce, they don&rsquo;t seem to
        be needed. Altogether, though these fellows lead
        a hard life, and are often coarse and dissipated,
        they have opinions of their own, and must be
        reckoned with by the rulers of the country.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Next comes the Muskoka farmer living in his
        shanty, for that is pretty much the rule, although
        there is, of course, an occasional farmhouse of
        more pretentious appearance, and drawing a bare
        livelihood by his constant toil with antiquated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span> implements; most of the hay (the chief product,
        since it requires little care,) being cut by the
        scythe on patches of land cleared by years of
        toil, and in most cases thickly strewn with rocks,
        the only satisfaction that they have in their poverty
        being that they are independent.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It is difficult to conceive of culture and refinement
        under such circumstances. It may be
        well, however, to have one part of our population
        comparatively free from the two dangerous
        influences of our time, riches and luxury on
        the one hand, and, on the other, embittered and
        ignorant combinations actuated by selfish interests
        and swayed too largely by demagogues.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;My sojourn here, though not pleasant and
        not profitable from a business point of view, has
        opened an extensive field of thought. Of my
        companions the most interesting was the lumberman
        whose wife was sick, and who as a result was
        leaving the woods. I was quite interested by his
        ideas of human life, although they were not given
        in a scientific way. He was evidently a man of
        energy; one who took life seriously and who had
        his share of troubles. It was pathetic to hear the
        way he spoke of how his wife&rsquo;s family usually
        died at about twenty-four years of age, how his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span> wife was now at that age and was sick. In fact,
        there are worse places than the lumber woods for
        the study of man.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In the spring of 1898 he was rejoiced at
    having the opportunity of conducting a more
    or less extended inquiry into the conditions
    of working men in the several trades.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;The <i>Mail</i>,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;intends, during the
        coming summer, to publish a series of articles
        concerning the conditions, social, moral and economic,
        governing each of the various trades, the
        facts to be gathered by personal observation and
        enquiry from journeymen, apprentices, employers
        and employees. The work is to be a feature of
        each day&rsquo;s paper, and, <i>mirabile dictu</i>, the entire
        charge of the matter, design and detail, has been
        handed over to me. I need not say that I am
        pleased. I have at once an opportunity of
        examining into the industrial and sociological
        conditions of the city and province, and possibly
        of doing good to my fellow men as the result of
        these observations. Incidentally, also, I have an
        opportunity of strengthening myself in my own
        profession, although that is a thing that one can
        do in journalism no matter what line of work one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> is pursuing. Roughly described, the aim of the
        series of sketches is to indicate to the parent what
        qualifications are required for, and what returns
        are to be expected from, the several vocations, in
        order that he may the better decide what to do
        with his boy or girl. I appreciate the responsibility
        which the work places upon me, and pray
        that I may be able to meet it.&rdquo;</p>

    then twenty-four years of age, and which appeared
    under the caption &ldquo;What to do with
    your boy or girl,&rdquo; were continued in the <i>Mail</i> from day to day for several months,
    and attracted very considerable attention at
    the time. They disclose a remarkable ability
    to get at facts, and the strongest sympathy
    with the end in view, and constitute a not unimportant
    contribution to the scanty literature
    which has thus far appeared, having to do
    with industrial and labour conditions in the
    Dominion.</p>
<p>The human interest which made even the
    dry language of statutes to glow with animation
    for him, is abundantly apparent from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> the following passages in reference to some
    of his work in the department of labour:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;I spent most of the day in the Library of Parliament,
        reading up the provincial acts concerning
        mining. The thing which impressed me, as I
        read, was the uninviting nature of the task of the
        miner, cut off from the light of day, hewing away
        in the bowels of the earth, exposed to the danger
        of cave-ins, explosions, and a living entombment,
        as the result of carelessness on the part of his employers,
        or his associates, or the will of nature.
        How can such men, if they are crowded down
        almost to the margin of subsistence, develop a
        roseate view of life! Ever facing almost terrorizing
        conditions, they must become brave, sturdy,
        self-reliant and earnest enough, but how can they
        fail to be out of sympathy with the shams, hypocrisies
        and dilettantisms of modern society!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And again:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;At the office, I have been much interested in
        working upon the article on the Fisheries of
        Canada, inasmuch as it has shown to me a sturdy
        class of men toiling under conditions of hardship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> and danger for what is comparatively a small return.
        Doubtless the isolation of the fishing villages,
        the system of part proprietorship, and the
        passion for a sea-faring life, account for the relative
        immobility of the population.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I am becoming more and more convinced
        daily of the fact that this country is going through
        a transition stage which must influence it to the
        bottom. The use of machinery, the weakening
        of the artisan by removing the rewards of skill,
        the work and wages of girls, the prevalence of
        piece work and its results, the effects of pauper
        and convict labour, and a thousand other problems
        are brought daily before my notice in terms
        of flesh and blood.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It is important to know and understand all
        sorts and conditions of men if society as a whole
        is to be led towards what is better. Certainly
        the &lsquo;better class of people&rsquo; need leading as well
        as the others, for with them the opportunity
        offered by leisure is too often wasted in dilettantism
        and folly.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>To &ldquo;society,&rdquo; in the highly specialized
    meaning of that word, a reference may not
    be out of place. In its ambitions, its man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>dates,
    Harper saw but little which made for
    the development of true manhood or womanhood,
    while he saw much which aimed directly
    at the destruction of both. There was
    never any one who enjoyed more the pleasure
    of good company, whose temperament,
    frank, hearty and mirthful, and whose manner,
    courteous and sincere, made him a more
    welcome guest wherever he went. It was no
    affectation, therefore, which caused Harper
    to feel as he did; it was his belief in the true
    purpose of life. What to some, and to himself,
    was a pastime, he saw, to others, was becoming
    an end; instead of developing, it was
    robbing, natures of their finer sensibilities.
    Many of its conventions were wholly artificial,
    some of its relationships altogether false.
    The following short sentences are sufficient
    to reveal this view:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;Social engagements may, I think, be a healthy
        relaxation, if kept in their place, and if one does
        not forget to keep hold of one&rsquo;s self, and remembers
        the force of example. With many people
        here in Ottawa, I fear the social round is becom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>ing
        an end in itself, and therefore a danger to
        themselves and others.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I am coming to the conclusion that if a man
        is to wield any influence worth while in this
        world, he has to cut this folly out of his life. The
        past fortnight has shown me how impossible it is
        for a man to do what the social world expects of
        him, and do justice to himself.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Commenting on a wedding notice which
    appeared in a local paper, he writes:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;So spoke the society editor this morning.
        The important thing, really, was the happy union
        for life of two loving hearts. Apparently what
        the public is supposed to be interested in, is the
        gown of white something or other. It may be
        salutary, as a means of developing an æsthetic
        taste generally, to have space in our public prints
        for such trifles. For my own part, I often think
        the world would be better and saner if the society
        editor had never been born.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And of the &ldquo;better part,&rdquo; in a personal letter
    to a friend:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;If you will pardon me for making the remark,
        I was very pleased to see the lively interest your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> sisters take in the great work of improving the
        condition of the masses. It is one which is bound
        to widen their sympathies, and remove any possibility
        of their becoming enthralled by the chains of
        hollow conventionality, which, more than anything
        else, prevents the development of true womanhood,
        under the conditions of our modern society.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>How, according to his view, true womanhood
    might be developed, may be gathered
    from a letter written by Harper to one of
    his sisters a short time before his death. It
    is one of many home letters which might be
    quoted, but it may be taken by itself as characteristic.
    In speaking of his love for others,
    its reproduction here may not be out of place:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p class="sign"> &ldquo;<i>Ottawa, Oct. 4th, 1901.</i></p>
    <p class="pn">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear L&mdash;&mdash;</span>:</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I am not writing to give you news, for there
        is little to give. I have been having a quiet
        happy little evening all by myself, and I thought
        I could not do better than let you into the secret
        of my happiness. I think I have told you before
        that I am an admirer of the high-mindedness of
        Matthew Arnold, &lsquo;the apostle of sweetness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> light.&rsquo; Latterly, I have been taking a great deal
        of true pleasure from his poems, and one of the
        best of them, <i>The Buried Life</i>, I have just finished
        reading, not for the first time, for they
        stand many readings; and I am sure you would
        find it hopeful and inspiring. I wish you would
        read Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s works, particularly some
        of the poems, such as <i>Rugby Chapel</i>, <i>Dover
        Beach</i>, <i>Self Dependence</i> and <i>The Buried Life</i>;
        the last, most of all. There is a good deal of the
        stoical Greek about Matthew Arnold, but his is a
        beautiful, noble, pure mind whose example makes
        the pursuit of perfection meaningful, and beautiful
        to contemplate. There is much in his
        philosophy with which you doubtless will not
        agree, but there is a richness, beauty and purity,
        which you will find most inspiring.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;And this brings me still to another question.
        Why should not you and E&mdash;&mdash; turn this winter
        to profit by spending a part of every day reading
        aloud to each other, choosing, preferably, such
        works as <i>The Idylls of the King</i>, Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s
        poems, or other writings of the great masters
        in literature which take one away from the
        sordidness of life, and tend to develop the best
        that is in one. This, with an adulteration of fic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>tion,
        would make the winter very profitable as
        well as very enjoyable to you both. When E&mdash;&mdash;
        can find time, he could read with you, and direct
        your reading course. My dear L&mdash;&mdash;, I am becoming
        more and more convinced every day that
        the most important duty we have is the moulding
        of our character; for it is in the strength and
        richness of our character that we obtain the title
        to self-respect, and are able to influence others.
        It is by bringing ourselves into closer contact
        with the highest thought that we are going to be
        enabled to obtain high-mindedness and purity
        ourselves. There is a world of truth in the statement,
        &lsquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they
        shall see God,&rsquo; and these things of which I speak
        are some of the ways of attaining that purity of
        heart which makes life richer, deeper and happier.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Longfellow, in his prose romance, <i>Hyperion</i>,
        has something of what I have in mind, when he
        says:</p>
    <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is the part of an indiscreet and troublesome
        ambition to care too much about fame,
        about what the world says of us; to be always
        looking into the faces of others for approval; to
        be always anxious for the effect of what we do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> and say; to be always shouting to hear the echo
        of our own voices. If you look about you, you
        will see men who are wearing life away in feverish
        anxiety of fame, and the last we shall ever
        hear of them will be the funeral bell which tolls
        them to their early graves! Unhappy men and
        unsuccessful! because their purpose is, not to accomplish
        well their task, but to clutch the &ldquo;fantasy
        and trick of fame&rdquo;; and they go to their
        graves with purposes unaccomplished, and wishes
        unfulfilled. Better for them, and for the world in
        their example, had they known how to wait!
        Believe me, the talent of success is nothing more
        than doing what you can do well; and doing well
        whatever you do,&mdash;without a thought of fame.
        If it comes at all, it will come because it is deserved,
        not because it is sought after. And,
        moreover, there will be no misgivings, no disappointment,
        no hasty, feverish, exhausting excitement.&rsquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;This is rather a heavy quotation for a letter,
        but I wished you to catch the thought, you will
        find it in the chapter in <i>Hyperion</i> on <i>Literary
        Fame</i>. You will see the truth of it, if you allow
        your mind to dwell upon it for a moment. Longfellow
        has no thought of discouraging ambition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> Far from it. He simply wants to emphasize the
        folly of hoping for fame which is undeserved, and,
        as he points out, the way to deserve it is by doing
        well what is to be done. But as you are not fame
        hunting, it is not the fame part of it that I wish
        to dwell upon here, so much as the parallel
        thought, that it is the inner life, the inner strength
        which comes from resolute effort and familiarity
        with the best thought, which tells, and which
        makes for true happiness.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I have often told you that your worst danger
        is your tendency to worry, a tendency which is
        based, I know, upon the depth of the interest
        which you take in those who are dear to you.
        What you must do is to prevent that tendency
        from casting a shadow over your life. I have a
        picture of you&mdash;a copy which W&mdash;&mdash; enlarged
        from the little sunbeam of you, with a big white
        hat, you remember,&mdash;in a gold frame over my
        desk. It is much admired, and I am proud to
        introduce it as my sister. As I look at it, I can
        see my dear little sister, bright, happy and devoted,
        and now I don&rsquo;t want to think of her with
        any unnecessary cares. Now do be good, and
        you and E&mdash;&mdash; try and make the winter profitable
        to both of you. Take walks, get exercise in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> open air, be cheerful, read, and generally try and
        make life happier by the means which you have
        at hand. I am neither scolding nor lecturing,
        and I have said nothing which you do not already
        know, but somehow to-night, you have been running
        in my mind, and I wanted to tell you what
        I thought and wished, so that, in due course of
        time, you will look back to the winter of 1901 as
        one of the happiest chapters in your life. I am
        sorry that, when we were in Barrie, the shadow
        of memories and the pressure of many things
        must have made me seem selfish and not kind
        enough to my sisters, but I need not tell you,
        L&mdash;&mdash;, that your happiness is dear to me.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;And now I must close. So good-night, my
        dear little sister.</p>
    <p class="center"> &ldquo;With much love,</p>
    <p class="sign">&ldquo;Ever your affectionate brother, <br />
        &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Bert</span>.&rdquo;<br />
    </p>
</div>
<p>Just how characteristic this letter is of the
    interest taken by Harper in the welfare and
    happiness of those to whom he was united
    by the closest of ties, will be apparent from
    another letter, written many months previous,
    to a brother in New York, after return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>ing
    from a short visit to that city. It reveals
    the same earnest endeavour of a life to impart
    its own secret to the lives of others, and
    to establish a standard of happiness which
    could bring no deceptions. Its practical common
    sense will make it no less commendable
    as an evidence of the truest affection.</p>
<p>He writes:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p class="sign"> &ldquo;<i>Ottawa, Dec. 30, 1900.</i></p>
    <p class="pn">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear Will</span>:</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Since returning to Ottawa there has been
        little happening that would be of interest to you.
        I have been busy enough, and have managed to
        control a tendency, fostered by the invitations of
        a number of kind people here, and my own disposition,
        to be drawn into the social whirl. It is
        weak, and life is earnest, so I have decided to do
        with as little of it as possible. No man who desires
        to make progress in this world, can hope to
        do so if he squanders his evenings. There are
        two ways in which a man may equip himself so
        that he may be in the van of progress:&mdash;first, by
        strengthening his own mind through a study of
        what is and has been in the minds of great men
        of thought,&mdash;this, one can do from books;&mdash;sec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>ondly,
        by pursuing positive original work along
        the special line to which he has devoted himself.
        These things I am attempting to do. The difficulty
        lies in selection. What we have to do is to
        get away from the semblances, and get at the realities
        of life.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Of Carlyle&rsquo;s <i>Hero Worship</i>, I have already
        spoken to you. It is healthy and sturdy. I am now
        reading Carlyle&rsquo;s <i>Past and Present</i>, and do not
        know anything in literature more wholesome or
        worth reading. Do not neglect to read it. Men of
        the stamp of Carlyle, Emerson and Matthew Arnold
        go to the root of questions, and their books will
        do you one hundred times as much good as all
        the novels which are going the rounds. Every
        man owes it to himself to supply his mind with
        the best material available, and, although Carlyle
        may seem a little heavy in parts, where one may
        not have become familiar with the subject matter
        he refers to, you will find the influence of his
        sturdy personality upon your own views of life.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;With regard to the second point,&mdash;work along
        one&rsquo;s own special line,&mdash;I am plodding along at
        work in the field of economics, and hope to be
        able to get out a book in the more or less near
        future. You know best what will be profitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span> for you. What I would suggest is, that you lose
        no opportunity of familiarizing yourself with the
        best writings on architecture; that you devote
        time and thought to studying architectural models
        of buildings as they are, and otherwise; and, that
        you take every opportunity to attend lectures or
        discussions where architectural subjects are being
        considered. In this way you will find your interest
        in your work, and in life generally, as well as
        your usefulness to your employers, increasing at a
        surprising rate. I know how hard it is for a man
        living in a great, interesting place like New York,
        to do deliberate, consecutive work, and to keep
        control of himself and his time, but he must do
        this, if he is going to get along. Life is real and
        earnest, and a man who is going to hold up his
        end in dull times, and in the autumn of life, must
        take every opportunity to equip himself, and to
        save his dollars. A man need not be mean, he
        can go to things worth going to, he can dress
        decently, and hold up his end generally; but
        there are lots of things upon which money is often
        spent, which are absolute folly. Money is hard to
        make, and a man cannot justify himself in throwing
        it away.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I hope you will pardon all this which may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span> appear like a lecture. It is not, I can assure you,
        dear old Will. It is simply a few conclusions
        which I have come to, and which I believe to be
        absolutely true. If they are, why should we not
        follow them? I want us both to live fruitful and
        useful lives, and it is by such conscious, deliberate
        work as I have referred to, that we both can
        do it. Let us cut asunder what of empty, unprofitable
        conviviality, and the like, may have
        grown into our lives, and let us live so that when
        we are old men,&mdash;if we are spared,&mdash;we may
        look back upon our lives without regret, and feel
        that we have been worthy of the best that is in
        us, and of the trust which our dear parents placed
        in us.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;My visit to New York was thoroughly profitable;
        it has given me much food for thought, and
        has enabled me to see some things more clearly
        than ever before. I cannot tell you of all the
        impressions New York brought, and has left upon
        me. I have never quite managed to shake off
        the attitude of mind of a student, and I find myself
        constantly weaving my experiences in New
        York into my philosophy of life. The two events
        which seem to stand out most clearly are the visit
        to the <i>Art Museum</i>, and the concert at the <i>Metro</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span><i>politan</i>.
        That was a glorious day, for it showed
        how men in the rush and flurry of business life
        have at hand the means of soul purifying and refreshment
        in art and music, two great agencies
        which bring men&rsquo;s minds back from semblances
        to truth. Will you ever forget the music we
        heard? The singing of Rossini&rsquo;s <i>Stabat Mater</i> was to me like wandering through a sea of dreams,
        beautiful yet sad. Greatest of all, I thought,
        was Nordica&rsquo;s <i>Inflammatus</i>, a soul-stirring song,
        splendidly set off by the orchestra and chorus,
        and which stirred the vast audience to its depths.
        It was the great victory of the evening. How
        strong must be the satisfaction of the possession
        of so magnificent a voice, both in the capacity to
        interpret such beautiful music, and in the ability
        to thrill and purge the human soul. For is it not
        the case that great music ever does this? I know
        little of the <i>technique</i> of music, but for years I
        have felt its influence upon me for good.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Every hour of my visit was profitable, and I
        need not say that it would have been a blind,
        stupid ramble without your assistance. I know
        what it meant in sacrifice of time and hard-earned

<p>It is not surprising to find in a remote corner
    of the diary of a man whose feelings were
    so genuine, and sympathies so sincere, such
    mention as the following, of an evening spent
    with &ldquo;The Woodcutters,&rdquo; a society he had
    helped to organize the year after he left the
    university, and the purposes of which will be
    sufficiently clear from the reference:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;We went to old Thomas Mahoney&rsquo;s where
        we worked hard from about 8:30 to 11:00 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>,
        sawing and splitting wood. The family consisted
        of Mrs. Mahoney, an old woman of about
        sixty or sixty-five, and her daughter. The
        daughter, who is half-witted, goes out washing
        and scrubbing, while the old lady has to saw
        and split all the wood necessary to keep their
        hovel warm, it being situated in an exposed place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span> on the edge of the common. The interior does
        not betoken wealth, but the old woman and her
        daughter seem to be not unhappy, this probably
        because of their having come from the Emerald
        Isle. I shall try and follow up the acquaintance
        with a view to discovering to what causes their
        poverty is due. This institution is a good one,
        for besides the hard work, it affords undoubtedly
        a good way of helping the deserving poor, and
        gives one a splendid chance for economic study.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Nor is the following entry less surprising,
    written, as it was, in part justification of himself,
    lest he should have erred in having aided
    financially, and in other ways, a deaf-mute
    boy who came to him for assistance, but into
    whose circumstances he had not, at the time,
    had opportunity of making a personal inquiry.
    A file of correspondence with the
    Charity Organizations officer, and the superintendent
    of <i>The Institute for the Deaf and
    Dumb</i>, reveals the care with which he subsequently
    satisfied his conscience in this particular
    case of one who belonged to &ldquo;the
    dependent and neglected poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;Whatever may be held regarding the unwisdom
        of a paternal system with regard to society
        generally,&mdash;and while my own best judgment inclines
        me to be individualistic,&mdash;I have a strong
        sympathy with those who are robbed of the use
        of their senses, to whom so much of the beauty
        of God&rsquo;s world is as a sealed book. I felt this
        strongly as I dictated the letters which he could
        not hear. The bright intelligence on his face as
        he learned my intention, and indicated his approval
        of some of my suggestions, was beautiful
        to see. I trust that he will not prove a disappointment,
        and that I shall not be deceived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harper had the faith which led him at
    times to cast his bread upon the waters.
    Had he been asked why he did so, he would
    have replied, because he loved to. If questioned
    further, he would, with Tennyson,
    have said:</p>

<h2><a name="SOCIAL_AND_POLITICAL" id="SOCIAL_AND_POLITICAL"><i>SOCIAL AND POLITICAL
    IDEALS</i></a></h2>
<p>Few men of his years have thought as
    deeply as Harper did, or had clearer
    perceptions, concerning conditions and
    forces which make for happiness and progress
    in social life, and the development of national
    greatness. Had he been spared he would
    have been an earnest and practical reformer;
    silent as his voice is now, the words he once
    uttered are not without their value to our
    day and generation. He was a true patriot
    in sentiment and aspiration.</p>
<p>Harper loved his country and its people,
    and in all that he undertook, which was of a
    public nature, he was animated by an enthusiasm
    for the common good. Of the self-imposed
    tasks he had undertaken in addition to
    his regular duties at the department of labour,
    and in each of which he had made some progress,
    were treatises on &ldquo;Labour Legislation in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> Canada,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Outlines of an Industrial
    History of the Dominion.&rdquo; Among his contributions
    to publications other than the <i>Labour
    Gazette</i>, was a short essay on <i>Colleges
    and Citizenship</i> in a Christmas number of
    the <i>Acta Victoriana</i> of Victoria College, one
    or two articles in <i>The Commonwealth</i> on <i>Canada&rsquo;s
    Attitude Towards Labour</i>, and an uncompleted
    monograph, intended for publication,
    on <i>The Study of Political Economy in the
    High Schools</i>. He was president of the Ottawa
    Social Science Club, secretary-treasurer
    of the Ottawa section of the University of
    Toronto Alumni Association, and an active
    member of the Ottawa Literary and Scientific
    Society. He was at the same time promoting
    the organization of a University Club, a plan
    of which he had carefully prepared, and the
    object of which was to bring the university
    men of the city into closer touch with each
    other, and make their influence more widely
    felt in the civic and social life of the community.</p>
<p>The background of all Harper&rsquo;s thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span> on social and political problems was coloured
    by his belief in a moral order; in the forefront
    was ever the individual proclaiming this
    order, and seeking to realize it in his own
    life. Institutions of whatever kind, whether
    national or religious, were to him of human
    creation. Their usefulness was in proportion
    to the degree to which they helped to give
    expression to the unseen purpose in the universe.
    Nature and man, alone, were divine.
    It followed logically from this that man&rsquo;s
    work among his fellows in the world was to
    discover the moral order, reveal and maintain
    it, so far as within him the power lay.
    Harmony with this order meant happiness,
    want of harmony, whether by the individual
    or the state, unhappiness. In this view, the
    individual is vastly superior to any institution
    he and his fellows may construct, superior as
    an end, and as a means to an end. If a set
    of conditions exist which are counter to the
    moral order, or obstruct its fulfillment in the
    lives of men, these conditions should be
    changed, the individual should not be sacri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>ficed
    to them. On the other hand, change
    may be, and ought to be accomplished more
    by men than by institutions, and can only be
    accomplished in the degree to which beliefs become
    active, potent factors in individual lives.</p>
<p>It is true that human knowledge is limited,
    and that the purpose of God is infinite,
    and so there may rightly be among men differences
    of opinion as to what, under any
    circumstances, are the ends to be sought, and
    the best means to attain those ends; and humility
    may well characterize all expressions
    of belief relative thereto; but, to the extent
    of knowledge gained, the ground underfoot
    is firm, and humility will not excuse the want
    of assertion, where right reason is set at
    naught by wrongful conduct. Moreover, there
    is much on which men can be agreed, broken
    arcs visible to all, though the perfect round is
    seen by none. There are right and wrong,
    truth and falsehood, honesty and dishonesty,
    love and hate, purity and vice, honour and
    dishonour, and the difference between them
    is as apparent and real as the difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span> &rsquo;twixt day and night, albeit, now and again, a
    twilight of uncertainty may render doubtful
    the confines of separation. Harper&rsquo;s exclusive
    insistence was only upon what in this
    way was acceptable to all; and knowing that
    it was acceptable, he was sure the appeal
    would find a response in those to whom it
    was addressed. Whatever men might be in
    seeking privately their own selfish ends, their
    belief in a moral order was apparent once
    action became collective; the public had a
    conscience to which it was generally true,
    though men at times might seem to betray
    their better selves; and public opinion might
    be expected to guard for society as a whole
    a right for which individuals sometimes lost
    respect. How great, therefore, was the responsibility
    upon those who had the capacity,
    or opportunity, to see that public opinion was
    rightly formed and directed, and that, in social
    and political affairs, truth and right
    should be made to prevail!</p>
<p>This insistence upon the recognition of
    responsibility in those favoured by educa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>tional
    training or opportunity, is well brought
    out in a paragraph or two in the short essay
    on <i>Colleges and Citizenship</i>. Referring to a
    quotation from Sir Alfred Milner&rsquo;s life of
    Arnold Toynbee, in which &ldquo;the estrangement
    of the men of thought from the leaders of the
    people&rdquo; is referred to as having constituted,
    in Toynbee&rsquo;s mind, the great danger of the
    democratic upheaval of the time, Harper
    writes:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;People in Canada to-day are doubtless not so
        anxious about democratic upheaval. Fortunately
        the aggravated conditions of an old world metropolis
        have not yet been developed. The task
        is easier; the duty none the less imperative. It
        is more possible to secure the confidence of men
        who are not embittered by the pangs of slumdom.
        But because conditions here are not as distressing
        as they have been and are elsewhere, it is surely
        no less desirable, with a view to promoting industrial
        peace and healthy national development,
        that the men who have opportunity and capacity
        for the serious study of social and economic problems,
        should not allow themselves to become
        fenced off by a wall of indifference of their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span> creation from those to whom the mass of the
        people look for direction, inspiration and suggestion.
        It is reasonable to expect that he who
        claims to be engaged in the pursuit of truth should
        not give countenance to what makes for social
        disorder and national decay.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Men are as much open to reason, as liable to
        accept truth, when they have been convinced of
        it, as when Arnold Toynbee studied, lectured and
        wrote. They are as prone to prefer what is genuine
        to what is pretense and dissimulation.
        Surely a peculiar obligation to see that men think
        rightly and act sanely, devolves upon those whose
        vantage ground should enable them to distinguish
        what is genuine. Sir Alfred Milner, having in
        mind the earnest friend of his undergraduate
        days, said six years ago to the members of Toynbee
        Hall: &lsquo;I do not go so far as to say that
        what Oxford thinks to-day England will do to-morrow,
        but certainly any new movement of
        thought at the universities in these days rapidly
        finds its echo in the press and in public opinion.&rsquo;
        Indeed, is there not fair ground for the belief
        that much of the virtue which has marked the
        conduct of Great Britain&rsquo;s High Commissioner
        at Cape Town, throughout the South African crisis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span> is due to association with the high-minded student,
        who, in the congenial atmosphere of Oxford,
        did not forget that he was a citizen?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It was his belief in the importance of men
    recognizing their duties as citizens, and being
    able to discharge these duties with intelligence
    and for the common good, which
    led Harper to prepare a scheme for the teaching
    of Political Economy in the high schools.
    The merits of this plan he had summarized
    as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;Such a study would tend to remedy the great
        evil of democratic institutions, the susceptibility
        of the masses to the influence of demagogues,
        and their liability to misconstrue the relations of
        cause and effect because of ignorance. It would
        tend to promote mental development, especially
        in the direction of individual thought. It would
        tend to raise the standard of such studies in the
        universities, and this in time would react upon
        the high schools in the way of more competent
        teachers, and, in the end, create great possibilities
        for the prosecution of research in this all important
        branch of knowledge in our country. It
        would tend to remedy social evils by giving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> philanthropist and the public generally, something
        like an accurate idea of the true state of society.
        It would react beneficially upon the government,
        which, with a more critical observation,
        would be more careful in its actions.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>He modestly concludes,</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;I simply put forward a proposal which, I
        think, if carried out, would tend to modify the
        evils fostered by ignorance. I have to a great extent
        taken it as an axiom that whatever tends to
        disseminate knowledge, to advance truth, and to
        develop the intellect, cannot be wrong, and should
        be accepted by all liberal minded men; and this,
        I think, would be the result of the study of Political
        Economy in our high schools.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>From the notes he had made, and from
    what is contained in the body of the article,
    it would appear that he had in mind a course
    on <i>Civic Ethics</i>, quite as much as on the <i>Elements
    of Economics</i>, and that he would have
    liked, if possible, to have had a beginning
    made in the public schools.</p>
<p>Scattered throughout his diary are such
    observations as the following:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;I am becoming more and more convinced
        that the true rulers of the nation are outside of
        our parliaments and our law courts, and that the
        safety of society lies in informing those who form
        public opinion.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;I feel more and more the necessity of emphasizing
        the importance of the scientific study
        of economic and political problems in a country
        in which every man has the franchise, and is supposed
        to be in a position to express an intelligent
        opinion upon public questions, and particularly
        at a time when labour and kindred problems are
        prominent in the public mind.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;A man who truly loves his country should

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;The poor downtrodden have more to hope
        for from men who, having a specialized training
        in the operation of social forces, apply themselves
        to the proper remedy, than from all the windy,
        ultra-radical demagogues.&rdquo;</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
    <p>&ldquo;It is the alienation&mdash;partly, no doubt, due to
        indolence&mdash;of the men of thought from those
        from whom the mass of the people habitually receive
        their inspiration, which accounts for much
        of the crass ignorance and purposeless passion of
        the people and their demagogues.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;For myself, I have long deplored the foolish
        worship of this or that set of political machinery
        by apparently well intentioned men. In Matthew
        Arnold&rsquo;s <i>Culture and Anarchy</i>, there is a solution
        for much of our distressing bluster and blunder.
        With confidence in the possibilities of man
        and a resolute endeavour to strive towards perfection,
        to allow our best consciousness to play
        about our stock notions and our painful conditions
        of society, we should be able to see the real
        value of things, and ultimately to approach more
        nearly to right and truth. If our well-intentioned,
        but perhaps &lsquo;over-Hebraized&rsquo; ultra-socialists and
        ultra-individualists would have perfection more
        prominently in mind than the pet panacea they
        have ever before them, and would allow their best
        consciousness to play about their notions of society
        and its evils, there would be less of viciousness
        and ignorance in their propaganda.&rdquo;</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>
    <p>&ldquo;The fallacy of political panaceas! And the
        vital importance of improving the individual
        morally, and encouraging him to elevate his
        ideals! What a splendid thing it would be if
        every labour agitator, every demagogue, every
        member of parliament, every professor, teacher
        and minister, and, in fact, every one who exerts
        an influence upon the public mind, could realize
        and act upon the truth which came to Alton
        Locke after his life of bitter trial: &lsquo;My only
        ground was now the bare realities of life and

<p>The true mind is revealed in its unconscious
    moments, and it is, therefore, from passages
    like these, casually expressed, and constantly
    recurring in much that he wrote, which was
    of a private nature, that his real views and
    beliefs are to be gathered. One or two other
    passages in a similar vein will disclose these
    views more fully.</p>
<p>During Christmas week of 1900 he visited
    New York for the first time. Of the many
    impressions made upon his mind, the contrasts
    of wealth and poverty, and all that they
    implied, were to him more real than aught
    else.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;What was particularly irritating to me,&rdquo; he
        writes in his journal, after returning from this trip,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> &ldquo;was the constant evidence of the power of money
        rule in that throbbing metropolis. The story is
        written, even on the store signs on Broadway, that
        this, the greatest commercial city in America, is
        practically owned by monied persons, whose tastes
        and ambitions strike one as being essentially low,
        mean and vulgar. I felt strongly a growing pride
        in British institutions and British character compared
        with what I saw about me. The ground
        taken by Mr. Mulock, on behalf of labour, came
        strongly before me. I felt that selfishness must
        be reckoned with in the solution of social problems.
        What is to be hoped is that strong men may be
        brought to see that right legislation is good politics,
        that they may thus be persuaded to lend
        their aid to those who hope to avoid the growth
        in Canada of a corrupt system by which the
        power is in the hands of the octopus who owns
        the money bags, and who fattens on the blood of
        the people whom he crowds under him. There is
        luxury and magnificence on Fifth Avenue, but I
        envied not the proud possessors of those costly
        mansions. I want naught but what my own
        ability and effort will bring me. I believe in
        making one&rsquo;s surroundings as beautiful as may
        be, but I feel that there is much waste and vulgar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span> display in the way in which wealthy New York
        arrays herself. Her luxury is ponderous and
        heavy and dull, when one remembers that much
        of it rests on the necks of the hundreds of thousands
        of toilers who gasp for breath in the narrow
        streets, from whom are withheld God&rsquo;s free gifts,
        the sunlight and the pure air.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Elsewhere, he writes after a walk through
    the city streets:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;On the way home I turned over in my mind
        the question as to how wealthy men come to be
        so much appreciated in spite of the fact that it is
        only the lovable in man which is truly loved&mdash;by
        right-minded men at all events, and I am satisfied
        that, consciously or unconsciously, men come
        to compromise with their own sense of justice in
        their estimate of men, until a habit of thought
        and regard is fixed. What goes forward is something
        like this: we do not love the man with
        the big house, but we would love to be the man
        with the big house. And since the man with the
        big house often has it in his power to get a bigger
        house than we have, we come to appreciate him.
        Many men do this until it comes to be usual to
        appreciate the man with the big house, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> comes to be a large figure in the eyes of the
        world, however little we may love him and his
        methods. This is particularly the case in a young
        nation like the United States which has, as yet,
        scarcely come to realize the really valuable things,
        an appreciation of which comes from genuine
        culture.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Again, whilst there is no great sin <i>per se</i> in
        being rich, I can see the truth in the old scriptural
        saying, &lsquo;It is easier for a camel to go through the
        eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into
        the kingdom of God.&rsquo; When it is so hard for an
        earnest student to keep his mind rivetted upon the
        eternal realities of life, through which character
        building and true happiness come, how much
        harder must it be for the man whose circumstances
        make the existing order, if not sufficient,
        yet comfortable, who has his vanity flattered by
        the things which he has been pursuing, and who
        has a vast web of houses and other possessions to
        shut him off from even an occasional view of the
        realities. These facts, of course, only hold in
        their general application and tendencies. There
        have been, doubtless, splendid rich men. When
        these reach that state when, of their own free will,
        and of deliberate choice, they are prepared to go,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span> sell all that they have, and give to the poor, then
        they have reached an attitude of mind and heart
        which enables them to distinguish between semblances
        and realities, to deliberately select the
        latter, and so realize the greatest happiness, the
        Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>His fine spirit is no less clearly revealed in
    the views which he held of the duties of the
    department of labour, and of the ideals he
    believed should govern and direct its work.
    The following extracts from letters to the one
    with whom he was associated, may serve to
    show with what purpose and to what end he
    had given himself to the work. The letters
    were written during the summer of 1901,
    while he was in charge of the department:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;As I lay in a hammock last night at Kingsmere,
        and gazed into the deep blue moonlit vault
        of heaven, and ran over in my mind the progress
        already made by the department, and taxed my
        imagination to see its future, the one formidable
        obstacle which I saw ever before us was the difficulty
        of keeping firm to one&rsquo;s convictions in the
        face of growing clamours for things which one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span> cannot approve, yet which are uttered by people
        whom one cannot ignore. Nevertheless, I am
        convinced that all will be well in the end. We
        will have the good will of the decent, fair-minded
        people, and that is all one should be much concerned
        about, after one has satisfied one&rsquo;s own
        sense of right and justice. I feel a deep sense of
        the gravity of our position, and I am determined
        that you shall command my best effort in your endeavours
        to make the work of the department effective,
        and to defeat unworthy attacks. I do not
        think that I am lacking either in faith in human
        nature or in the ultimate triumph of right, but I
        am coming to realize more, day by day, that it is
        a great man&rsquo;s work which we are called upon to
        perform. I have every confidence in our ability
        to weather the storms which we will undoubtedly
        be called upon to meet, and you can be assured
        that you will find me ready to do my share. It
        behooves us both to steadfastly keep before us
        those things which are true, and, if we do, Nature,
        as Carlyle says, will be on our side.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;The work on the <i>Labour Gazette</i> allows opportunity
        for a careful and searching analysis of
        the industrial and social life of the Dominion.
        Already I can see the practical usefulness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span> work. In addition to the obvious recognition of
        the claims of labour involved in the creation of
        the department, we have it in our power to publish
        information which should lead to a better
        understanding all round, as well as to further
        such movements as arbitration and conciliation
        which tend to promote industrial peace.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;With the added responsibility there has come
        to me an increasing sense of the usefulness of the
        work which we are doing. I believe we can do
        much towards determining the direction of social
        progress. With a knowledge of fact, an absence
        of sectarian prejudice, some understanding of the
        progress of human institutions, and of the motives
        which influence men, we should, if we can keep
        control of ourselves, and maintain high ideals as
        inspiration for the development of the best that is
        in us, be able to render a lasting service to this
        country.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In this connection his views as to the relation
    of the State and Labour, and of labour
    problems generally, may not be without interest.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;we should discourage
        anything that tends to prevent Canadian workers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> from being good citizens, and enough means and
        leisure to avoid the brutalizing tendency of suppressed
        bitterness and poverty, is necessary to
        that end. I am inclined to believe that healthy,
        rational development will be best furthered by
        restraining those influences which tend to lower
        the level of citizenship, and the material well-being
        of the mass of the workers in a country in which,
        as in Canada, the workers are an important element
        in the governing of the nation. Society
        must insist upon rules of fairness governing our
        industrial system, and upon frowning down the
        &lsquo;mean man.&rsquo; Let each individual have to himself
        the reward of his energy, and of his legitimate
        effort, but let him work in accordance with rules
        of fair play, and frown down, and banish, if need
        be, the &lsquo;mean man.&rsquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;There are those who have held that man has
        but one right, the right to live, if he can. Modern
        British democracy does not stop there. That
        same sense of self-respect which prevents us considering
        as tolerable a society which allows men
        and women, who are unable to provide for themselves,
        to lie down on the street and die, forces
        us to insist that there shall be some rules for the
        regulation of industrial life, more particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> where the parties in an industrial contest are of
        unequal strength. Most modern societies are
        prepared to admit that industry should be so conducted
        that men who are willing to work shall be
        allowed to work under as wholesome conditions
        as are reasonably possible, and that they shall be
        allowed such a return for their labour and so
        much leisure, as is necessary to health. For, to
        put it on no higher ground, no society, however
        hard hearted, can afford for long, when the remedy
        lies in its own hands, to countenance conditions
        which create in the hearts of reasonable
        men, that bitterness which tends to provoke social
        upheavals and revolutions.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Where the governing power is dependent
        upon the governed, no abstract theory of individual
        liberty or what not, will long prevent the
        State from taking cognizance of apparent and
        remediable injustice. Doctrinaire political philosophers,
        painters of Utopias, peddlars of political
        panaceas, still have their own little <i>nostrums</i> for society, but the law has been built up, as has
        seemed right or expedient to the law makers of
        the time, as a series of arbitrary rules based upon
        experience, and defining the terms upon which
        people may best live in each other&rsquo;s society.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>
    <p>&ldquo;The attitude taken by those who have fashioned
        British policy in industrial matters, recognizing
        the principle that upon individual ability
        and individual energy rests national progress,
        allows to the individual the enjoyment of the
        fruits of his industry. But it insists that in the
        getting of it he must be governed by rules of fair
        play. The rule which underlies the various
        labour laws seems to be &lsquo;leave well enough alone,
        but get after the mean man.&rsquo; A parent has a
        right to chastise his child, but that does not mean
        that he has a right to beat his child whenever he
        feels inclined, or allow him to be so worked as to
        start him in life a crippled, deformed, little creature.
        The Factories Acts, perhaps the best known
        department of labour legislation, both in England
        and in Canada, have been created to correct
        abuses, which would not have arisen but for the
        practices of hard-hearted employers. In order to
        thwart the mean man, who will consider neither
        the comfort nor the well-being of his employees,
        certain rules have been laid down, declaring how
        establishments, where abuses are likely to arise,
        shall be conducted.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;The generally accepted rule nowadays is, that
        good done is sufficient justification of an act, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span> the absence of evidence that equal or greater
        evil will follow. Take as an illustration the inspection
        of apples and pears, which does not fall
        within the scope of what is normally considered
        labour legislation. It was found that, left to
        themselves, some men who sold apples were so
        short-sighted as to fill the centre of the apple barrels
        with inferior fruit, straw, old boots, clothes,
        and other material which cost less than the hand-picked
        fruit of the Canadian orchards, and which
        could not be seen when covered up with rosy,
        sweet smelling Northern Spies. But the appetite
        of the British consumer does not extend to the
        contents of the refuse cart, and Canadian fruit
        growers as a whole suffered. Because some men
        are prepared to carry their meanness to the extent
        of counterfeiting, and of impairing the reputation
        of their countrymen, the Canadian parliament
        felt called upon, in the interest of common decency
        and the good of the apple trade, to require
        an inspection, which, while it will defeat the mean
        man, will involve the regulation of every honest
        Canadian shipper who is content to take his
        chances on the principle, &lsquo;<i>caveat emptor</i>.&rsquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Here, then, is an illustration which may be
        applied. Let every man stand upon his own feet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span> says the parliament at Westminster. Let every
        man choose and pursue his own aim in life, and
        have for himself the reward of his efforts. But
        where an abuse develops to such an extent that it
        becomes a menace to public safety, or an invasion
        of the rights of others, we are prepared to so legislate
        as to defeat the offender, whilst restricting
        individual enterprise to the least possible extent.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And of the application of the same principle
    of fair play to industrial disputes, he
    writes:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;Partly because society feels that it cannot afford
        to see the machinery of production tied up
        and inactive, partly because of the effect upon
        consumers of increased inconvenience and increased
        prices as the result of that suspension, but
        largely, I think, because society demands that the
        men who work shall have fair treatment, because
        the great heart of society, stripped of its shams,
        its semblances, its dilettantisms, its hypocrisies
        and its follies, demands that justice and fair play
        shall rule between man and man, that they who
        are willing to work with, their hands shall have a
        fair return for their work, and shall be allowed
        to work under fair conditions, it has come to pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span> that, in British countries, there is an answer to the
        demand of labour for some kind of arbitrament
        other than the strong hand, when the parties to
        an industrial dispute fail to agree. In New Zealand
        the answer has come in compulsory arbitration,
        which, at bottom, means, practically, the
        fixing of wages by the State. In Great Britain
        and Canada individualism will not go so far.
        Public opinion, for the time being at least, is satisfied
        with the creation of machinery for the operation
        of voluntary conciliation. We hope that
        public opinion will, in most cases and in the long
        run, strike a true note. Under modern conditions,
        as Carlyle says, &lsquo;Democracy virtually extant
        will insist upon becoming palpably extant.&rsquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Inasmuch as many industrial disputes have
        their origin in misunderstandings, and in sentimental
        alienations from the arbitrary disposition of
        one party or the other, the Acts in Great Britain
        and Canada, providing as they do for the appointment
        of an unbiased mediator to bring the parties
        together, are calculated to sweep away all unessential
        entanglements, and make the way clear
        for a settlement by means of amicable compromise
        without taking away from either of the parties
        the privilege, to which each claims a right, of using<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span> its strength to further its own legitimate individual
        ends. The existence of the machinery makes it
        difficult for either party in a serious dispute to refuse
        to employ it; the prestige of the government
        behind the conciliator enables him to deal freely
        with each party, and to throw the full light of day
        upon the real condition of affairs. This done,
        the full strength of the system of voluntary conciliation
        comes into play. Public opinion will
        force a settlement which approximates to justice
        and fairness. The mean party, whether it be the
        employer or the labour organization, must inevitably
        give way to the extent of its meanness, and
        at the same time, the right of the individual to
        realize for himself the fullest fruits of his legitimate
        effort, at once the stimulus of the capitalist,
        and <i>raison d&rsquo;être</i> of the trade union, is preserved.
        The system, it is true, acknowledges, at once, the
        imperfection of trade union machinery, and the
        selfishness, even to the extent of meanness, of
        employers; it goes further than the grasping and
        heartless employer would allow; it falls short of
        what many unionists, especially among the socialists
        in the organizations, would demand; but it
        adequately represents the general attitude of the
        British public in matters of labour legislation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span> generally, preserves the reward of individual effort
        to the individual who makes the effort, but
        makes it impossible for the mean man to profit by
        his meanness. Meanwhile, with the option, in
        case of disputes, of the arbitrament of public
        opinion, an employer is apt to give greater consideration
        to a proposal for the creation of a permanent
        conciliation board, representative of himself
        and his employees, to determine questions
        which may arise within his establishment.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Such a bringing together of the two classes
        in the producing scheme for the consideration of
        their mutual interests, as well as their mutual differences,
        is calculated to promote a harmony
        which should make for the great aim of all, the
        promotion of industrial peace. Granted the existence
        of a fair rate of wages and fair conditions
        of work, the existence of conditions, which can,
        with little difficulty, merge into a modified form of
        industrial association or partnership, and there is
        the vindication of the truth, that there is no necessary
        warfare between the parties to production.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Lastly, of Democracy; its problems were
    to him mainly industrial; a well informed
    public opinion was the one hope, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span> recognition of the duties of citizenship, the
    one necessity of the times. In obedience to
    a moral order lay the secret of happiness, for
    the heart of a people like the heart of man,
    was governed by truth.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;If we are to have faith in democracy, we must
        believe that the people, when informed, will choose
        what is right in preference to what is base. If
        we can judge of the disposition of the press and
        the expressed opinions of prominent men who
        give thought to the matter, Canada has deliberately
        set her face towards the promotion of industrial
        peace, the stamping out of the mean man.
        Canadians seem disposed to declare with Carlyle,
        that &lsquo;cash payment is not the sole nexus of man
        with man. Deep, far deeper than supply and
        demand are laws, obligations as sacred as man&rsquo;s
        life itself. He that will not learn them, perpetual
        mutiny, contention, hatred, isolation, execration,
        will wait on his footsteps, till all men discern
        that the thing which he attains, however golden
        it look or be, is not success, but the want of
        success.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;Working men are not asking for favours. In
        their federations less and less is heard of technical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> differences, and more of a desire to secure the
        good will of the general public by means of a
        cool, deliberate presentation of views upon public
        questions primarily affecting them. It is impossible
        not to accept the general views of Mr. Henry
        Compton, that as working men acquire their full
        rights, their leaders will turn to the noble task of
        impressing upon them the duties of citizenship.
        Outside of parliaments and law courts, the destiny
        of the nation&rsquo;s workers and employers is being
        shaped by the consciousness of right in the minds
        of the mass of the people.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;I have confidence that public opinion will, in
        most cases and in the long run, strike a true note.
        I have faith in the saying, &lsquo;the people may make
        mistakes, but the people never lie.&rsquo; Show the
        people what it all means, and the people will do
        what is right. They are learning the insufficiency
        of political catch words. They know that no political
        pill, call it by ever so attractive a word, is
        a cure for all ills.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;Whatever course we may pursue we must not
        forget that it is but a means to an end. Machinery
        is good, so long as we remember that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> is machinery. No system will, even for a short
        time, avoid industrial evils unless the people have
        respect for what is right and true and just. The
        present system has its omissions and its weaknesses,
        but it keeps in mind some of the principles
        of public policy, which experience has shown to
        be sturdy, sane and wholesome. I think it is a
        stride in the right direction. If men will but be
        true to themselves, a new era is dawning upon
        us; an era, which, if it will not be free of pain,
        hardship and suffering for many, will, while preserving
        a premium as a reward for the energetic,
        a punishment for the mean, leave the final judgment
        in industrial questions with public opinion,
        which, when informed, is ready to choose what
        is right in preference to what is base. The ultimate
        solution of industrial problems, now as never

<h2><a name="THE_PURPOSE_OF_LIFE" id="THE_PURPOSE_OF_LIFE"><i>THE PURPOSE OF LIFE</i></a></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I trust I may do my duty before God
    and man and realize the best that is in
    me.&rdquo; These words are among the last
    in Harper&rsquo;s diary. Five years before, referring
    to repeated disappointments and reverses
    he had written: &ldquo;I hope they will
    enable me to realize the high ideal of my
    existence.&rdquo; The same lofty purpose was
    expressed in the opening paragraph of his
    diary, already quoted. It reads:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am writing this record of my thoughts
    and actions in order that I may be better able
    to understand myself; to improve in that
    wherein I find myself wanting, and that
    some day I may be able to look back and
    find a rule of development or perhaps of life,
    with its assistance. I shall endeavour to be
    at least honest with myself, and hope that
    the use of this book may help me occasionally,
    to sever myself mentally from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span> associations of the world and retire within
    myself. My hope is that some day I may be
    able to become acquainted with my own individuality,
    and discover what is the first essential
    and object of my existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If love for others was the ruling passion,
    the realization of a high ideal was the constant
    purpose of Harper&rsquo;s life. He deliberately,
    at an early age, looked in upon his life;
    regarded it as a trust given him by the Creator
    to mould and fashion at his will; saw that
    it had capacities which he believed to be infinite
    and divine; and sought, by reflection
    and action, to unfold its meaning and to
    work out its end. &ldquo;There is a dreamy undercurrent
    in my whole make-up, which I have
    never been able to understand, but which
    sometimes seems to me to be more real than
    my waking life.&rdquo; Already the infinite mystery
    had become a great reality to him. His
    search was not in vain. Before its close,</p>

<p>Man found himself in a world surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span> by mortals like himself; two theories were
    possible, either all was chance, or there was
    design. If chance, there could be no ultimate
    meaning of things, no relation between the
    parts, either between the universe and man,
    or man and his fellows; truth and right there
    might be, by arrangement, but they could
    not be absolute; duty might exist, but under
    what law? No, the world, man,&mdash;these
    clearly were to be accounted for in some
    more rational way. The only alternative was
    design. The finite mind, seeking to interpret
    the Infinite, had invented a language, whereby,
    through the medium of words, it sought to
    give expression to its thoughts. A creator
    and an infinite purpose were essential to design;
    the creator, the finite mind conceived of
    as God, the infinite purpose, His will. To
    know God and to do His will became then
    the chief end of man.</p>
<p>From a consciousness of the mystery of his
    own being and of the universe about him,
    the earliest perception of the infinite nature
    of each and of their relation, came to Harper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span> in the discovery of what he was wont to call
    &ldquo;the rule of law.&rdquo; In Nature he found it
    first. In Nature there was no chance, all was
    cause and effect; there was constant change,
    but no final destruction. &ldquo;Immortal growth
    was the prophecy which Nature made for
    man.&rdquo; What the eye of the senses discovered
    in the physical world, the eye of the
    soul discerned to be true of the inner life.
    Character was not the child of Destiny, the
    shadow of Circumstance, it was the one
    immortal creation of which man was capable.
    &ldquo;What a man sows, that shall he also reap.&rdquo;
    In character was the harvest of all that a
    man ever thought, or willed, or did.</p>
<p>And herein lay the greatness of life. An
    order in the universe, a capacity in man to
    discover and interpret; Truth, the order; the
    path, Right; Reason, lighted by the lamp of
    Conscience, might lead man to the abode of
    God.</p>
<p>Without some satisfying of reason, Harper
    maintained there could be no true inspiration
    of soul; for a belief to be vital, it was neces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>sary
    that its significance should be grasped,
    and its meaning comprehended. It was secondary,
    therefore, <i>what</i> a man believed, so
    long as he had a reason for the faith that was
    in him, and was prepared to follow where an
    honest search might lead. In the end, the
    meaning of life would be clear. It was not
    against criticism or the critical spirit that he
    was prone to object, but against such divorced
    from an honest and sincere purpose. Honest
    criticism he believed was essential to clearer
    vision, and, reverently pursued, strengthened
    belief.</p>
<p>It was the intellectual honesty of Matthew
    Arnold which attracted Harper so strongly,
    and gave the writings of that author so great
    an influence over his life. What he has
    written, in reference to his reading of <i>Literature
    and Dogma</i>, is not without interest as
    showing the effect which this book had upon
    him, and as disclosing his own views in the
    matter of criticism and belief.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;I spent a good morning
        taking a look into <i>Literature and Dogma</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> which, so far as I have read, is in entire accord
        with Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s clear, critical method of
        examination. I was anxious to get at his main
        thesis, and read several chapters, as well as the
        conclusion, and think that as a result my own
        views regarding Christianity have been rather
        strengthened. A quibble always annoys me, but
        Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s criticism is of a different sort.
        For my own part, I am convinced that the critical
        spirit is not indicative of meanness, but rather of
        balance and honesty of mind, and is calculated
        to create, not blind prejudice, but wholesome conviction.
        This is particularly the case where the
        critic has, as in the case of Matthew Arnold,
        imaginative power properly controlled, and a
        deep appreciation of love and beauty.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And some days later:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;To-night I read several chapters of Matthew
        Arnold&rsquo;s <i>Literature and Dogma</i>, which, with
        what I have already read of the work, cleared my
        mind as to the main purpose of the author, the
        placing of our conception of the value of the
        Bible and of Christianity on a more stable and
        permanent basis. I feel confident that this will
        be the effect upon my own mind, for I thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span> hold that a belief to be vital must be real to him
        who professes it. Indeed, the profession to others
        of what one believes, however important, is almost
        inevitably vague, or, at least, liable to be misunderstood.
        What is really important is for us to
        believe what we ourselves find believable and true
        before the bar of our inmost conscience. I find
        myself reaching out with eagerness to the thought,
        which seems an old one to me, that God is intimately
        associated with conscience; that conduct
        is important, but that rules of conduct institutionalized
        are apt to be external and wanting
        in vital force; and that it was the emphasizing
        of the importance of the personal, inward condition,
        which was the real strength and lasting
        service of the new dispensation.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I find my views clearing as time goes on.
        Latterly two thoughts have been, perhaps, more
        prominent than any others: the importance of
        constant choice in the matter of selection and rejection,
        and a respect for the conception of the
        many sidedness of truth, which conception brings
        with it a toleration for the views of others, particularly
        in the matter of religion. For given
        that religion is an inward personal matter, and
        that men are constituted so differently, their con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>ceptions
        of the truth, itself single and indissoluble,
        if you will, must vary widely. Under such conditions
        the necessity of keeping in view the highest
        standard of life, as illustrated by Christ, becomes
        of the very greatest importance.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In the character of Christ, Harper found
    the answer to the question, what is the purpose
    of life? That life appealed to him from
    every side. It was the manliest of lives.
    Conscious of its greatness, it could forbear to
    use its creative powers for selfish ends. It
    could be governed by a principle, where a
    multitude could not attract. Bigotry, passion
    and prejudice only added force to its
    invectives; ridicule and calumny, dignity to
    its assertion of right. In the presence of the
    strong, it could champion the cause of the
    weak; the rich it could make to tremble at
    their neglect of the claims of the poor. In the
    midst of opposition, it could stand alone; surrounded
    by temptation, it could remain pure.</p>
<p>It was the manliest of lives. Chivalrous in
    its defense of woman, tender in its love for
    little children, loyal in its allegiance to friends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span> Uncompromising it was in its demands for
    truth, unsparing in its rebuke of evil, relentless,
    almost violent, in its denunciations of
    hypocrisy. Yet nowhere was such sympathy
    to be found; nowhere, greater compassion;
    nowhere, forgiveness more sincere.</p>
<p>It was the manliest of lives, but it was
    also the simplest and the best. In vain one
    searched for an account of material possessions;
    in vain one looked for an assertion of
    worldly place or power; but it was recorded
    that its cradle was a manger, its crown, a
    wreath of thorns. The mountains, the woods,
    the sea, the flowers, the stars, were so sought
    by, and so ministered to that life, as to be
    almost a part of it. Simple fisher-folk of
    Galilee, devoted but humble women in the
    town of Bethany, shared its companionship,
    the sorrowful and outcast, its love.</p>
<p>And withal, it had a mission, higher,
    greater than the world had ever known.
    Clearly it saw into the mystery of the universe,
    deeply it divined the meaning of the
    human soul. In words, as simple, as beauti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>ful,
    as the flower, or the name which suggested
    the thought, it related the universe to
    man, and man to God. &ldquo;Consider the lilies
    how they grow!&rdquo;&mdash;all that Nature had to
    teach was there, selection and rejection, cause
    and effect, the unfailing operation of law, life
    and death. &ldquo;Our Father,&rdquo;&mdash;obedience, love,
    trust, forgiveness, the brotherhood of man,
    man&rsquo;s sonship under God.</p>
<p>Was it a matter of wonder then, that such
    a nature as Harper&rsquo;s should be captivated by
    such a life? Having founded his belief on
    reason, in the following after the perfect life
    of Christ, reason was soon outrun by that
    which brought conviction of itself. Having
    learned something of the secret and the
    method of that life, Harper came soon to
    believe the words:</p>
<div class="poem">
    <table summary="poem">
        <tr>
            <td><div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>Ego sum via, veritas, vita,</i><br />
                    </span> <span class="i1"><i>Sine via non itur, sine veritate non</i><br />
                    </span> <span class="i1"><i>Cognoscitur, sine vita non vivitur.</i>&rdquo;<br />
                    </span> </div></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>
<p>They came to be the controlling power in his
    life.</p>
<p>Harper sought the realization of his belief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span> in conduct. His impurity, his weakness, he
    contrasted with the strength and beauty of
    the life of Christ, and daily sought with an
    earnest devotion to yield the allegiance due
    to the higher ideal. Without many professions,
    he strove silently for the attainment of
    a character which would make him, among
    men, not unworthy of the ideal which he cherished
    in his heart.</p>
<p>The following passages may help to make
    good the truth of these words:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;Idealism is not folly. It prevents folly. It
        is the main hope of a delirious world. It is the
        means of informing common sense. An ideal
        truly cherished is never lost, save to give place to
        a higher ideal. An ideal is not smashed by experience
        of frailty; but is rather thrown into
        greater relief. Ideals are dissipated only by the
        clearer view which comes with a widening horizon.
        Disappointment in persons will not make an
        idealist a cynic, unless he has no heart.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, all men are apt to reach out
        for the immediate thing which looms large before
        them. Some are worse than others. And it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> only by trying to see things in perspective, by the
        application of common sense enlightened by idealism,
        that we can hope to be among the wiser. A
        constant regard for perfection, the constant cherishing
        of an intelligent idealism, will, I think,
        help a man &lsquo;in the midst of the crowd to keep
        with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude,&rsquo;&mdash;Emerson&rsquo;s
        measure of a great man.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;On the place of churches in national and
        social life, I take the ground that the important
        thing for a man is his religion, what he actually
        believes regarding his relation to the universe,
        rather than his church affiliation. The first is individual
        and real, the latter more or less artificial
        and a matter of expediency, a means of assisting
        him in making easier the spread of the views
        which he holds; in fine, an institution, with an
        object doubtless, but none the less an institution,
        machinery.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;This has been a good day, in that life and
        human duty have been very real to me in it. In
        the afternoon H&mdash;&mdash;, L&mdash;&mdash; and I walked out
        Bank Street to the canal, and, on the way back, I
        turned the conversation to the question of man&rsquo;s
        duty to himself and to others, taking the position
        that a man owed it to himself to make the most
        of himself, and that, if he ever earnestly started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span> in on the task, he would find himself moved to see
        that his influence upon others was in the same
        direction, namely, towards perfection; that if
        men were once taught to see the working of the
        rule of law in this sense, they must inevitably recast
        their entire views of life to their own advantage
        and that of society; and that if the church,
        instead of saying do this, because this and that
        authority says it is right to do it, would appeal to
        a man&rsquo;s appreciation of what manhood means in
        this sense, there would be more Christlikeness
        among so-called professors of Christianity.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;This, my birthday, has commenced most
        happily. As I lay last night on the couch in our
        comfortable little room, allowing my thoughts to
        run on into the future, and resolving to make this
        new year of my life one marked by real and substantial
        progress, &mdash;&mdash; came to me about midnight
        with a birthday present, which, it seems to
        me, could not be more in keeping with my present
        state of mind and resolutions. The present
        consisted of two splendid engravings of Hoffman&rsquo;s <i>Christ, the Child</i>, and <i>Christ, and the
        Rich Young Man</i>. More and more, as time goes
        on, I am coming to realize that the virtues upon
        which the hopes of the world are based are to be
        found in that rich beautiful life of the Master.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> Humility, self-sacrifice and love, all that appeals
        to the noblest instincts of our nature, are to be
        found in the character of that perfect Man, who
        was &lsquo;despised and afflicted, yet opened not His
        mouth.&rsquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Trammelled by a liberal share of human
        weakness, an unfortunate combination of high ambition
        and a tendency to frivolity, I can only
        hope to come to realize gradually all that that life
        represents. When one considers the wide-spread
        influence which even a comparatively obscure
        personality yields in this world, the awful responsibility
        which is attached to every act of volition,
        to every word and deed, is forced upon one.
        These and other weaknesses I must control, and
        my character I must seek to strengthen in order
        that my life shall not be useless, in order that I
        may realize dear mother&rsquo;s last wish, that we may
        meet &lsquo;There.&rsquo; I must try, with the help of God, to
        more and more conform thought and act to the
        model of the perfect life of Christ, a life that if
        men and States would imitate, there would be an
        end to viciousness and of man&rsquo;s inhumanity to
        man. To be brought face to face, daily, with
        Hoffman&rsquo;s beautiful representation should make
        strong resolutions stronger and more possible of
        realization.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It is a beautiful day, the first really cold day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> of the winter. Rarely do I remember a clearer
        air, a brighter sun. To me, it is as if God smiles
        His approval on my resolutions. Pray God, I
        may be able to live them out in practice.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;I wrote to F&mdash;&mdash; to-night, and my heart
        went out strangely to him as I wrote. The
        thought which I wished most to convey to him,
        was the importance of combining nobility of mind
        with true humility in the sense in which Christ
        used the words; the truth in the simple but
        meaningful words of the beatitude, &lsquo;Blessed are
        the pure in heart for they shall see God&rsquo;; and
        the necessity, with a view to the healthy upbuilding
        of a strong character, to &lsquo;Be just and fear
        not.&rsquo; The more I am brought into contact with
        the views of the world, the more I see the wealth
        of meaning in some of the scriptural sayings. If,
        as I trust, this expansion in the meaning of things
        goes on, life should be filled with more and more
        real happiness, especially if I am able to so master

<h2><a name="A_LAST_WORD" id="A_LAST_WORD"><i>A LAST WORD</i></a></h2>
<p>The love, the truth and the beauty of
    Harper&rsquo;s nature have nowhere found
    better expression than in his last letters
    to his closest friend. His heart is revealed
    there, as, only in such a relationship, it is
    possible for hearts to reveal themselves. In
    the sanctuary of Friendship, everything is
    holy; there abideth the love that &ldquo;thinketh
    no evil,&rdquo; the confidence that is never betrayed;
    at its threshold, semblances disappear;
    having entered beneath its portals,
    there is no longer anything to conceal.</p>
<p>The one to whom they were written was
    in British Columbia when these letters were
    received by him. He had been sent by the
    government to reconcile, if possible, the conflicting
    claims of labour and capital, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> at the time had assumed the proportions of a
    strike in one of the mining towns of that
    province. In his absence, the department of
    labour had come in for some criticism at the
    instance of the Canadian Manufacturers&rsquo; Association.
    Harper was anxious lest this
    should be a matter of concern to his friend,
    and hastened to reassure him. The letters are
    a true expression of himself. They reveal
    his standards, his belief in truth, his appreciation
    of beauty, his conception of duty, his
    trust in an overruling Providence, his deep
    concern for humanity, and his love for his
    friend. All these, in him, were as inseparable
    from each other as each was inseparable from
    his life.</p>
<p>He writes:</p>

        week, weighing in my mind the chances of the
        success of your mission. It may be weak, this
        proneness to speculate upon the outcome of an
        issue in the future, but where one&rsquo;s feelings are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span> nearly concerned, one cannot but do it. Each
        time my thoughts have turned to the subject of
        your mission to the coast, my conclusion has been
        the same&mdash;you must succeed. To-day&mdash;the first
        breathing spell which I have had since you left&mdash;as
        I walked home in the bright sunlight and the
        brisk air, the conclusion has become conviction.
        I do not attempt to disguise the difficulties which
        confront you. Indeed, perhaps, I rather magnify
        them. Two camps of organized self-interest confront
        each other. Misunderstanding, bitterness
        and passion have much sway in each. But your
        strength lies in the fact that what you seek is fairness,
        truth and justice, as well as the promotion
        of industrial peace and the country&rsquo;s welfare.
        &lsquo;Speak to his heart,&rsquo; says Emerson, &lsquo;and the man
        becomes suddenly virtuous.&rsquo; My dear Rex, I
        assure you it is not the prejudice of a friendship,
        which makes me miss you more than I care to
        confess, that tells me that it is not the strong arm
        of a commission, nor yet the power of public
        opinion, that is your strongest weapon in this
        important crisis; but the commanding influence
        of a high-minded manhood moved by noble impulses,
        and unalloyed by selfish motive. Success
        must crown your efforts.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>
    <p>&ldquo;This week has been an instructive one in
        many ways. You have doubtless noticed the conclusion
        of the Canadian Manufacturers&rsquo; Association
        with regard to the <i>Labour Gazette</i> and the
        department&rsquo;s work generally. The decision,
        though not unexpected, is an evidence of how
        much must be done, before men, whose business
        principles are but a reflection of their personal interests
        as they conceive them, can be brought to
        see that right reason will not be satisfied by any
        industrial scheme which leaves out of account
        consideration for the well-being of the great mass
        of the people. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, in a conversation
        which I had with him on Friday, assured me that
        we ought not to worry over the verdict of the
        Manufacturers&rsquo; Association. &lsquo;For,&rsquo; as he put it,
        &lsquo;a department which stands for the recognition
        of the rights of working men cannot expect to be
        popular with selfish employers.&rsquo; Speaking of the
        comparison made between the Canadian and
        United States Departments, I urged upon him the
        importance of the publication of a monthly Gazette
        as a means of making effective a policy
        which depends for its sanction upon public opinion.
        He agreed with me, and added, &lsquo;They talk
        of a quarterly publication, doubtless they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span> be better satisfied still if there were no publication
        at all.&rsquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s opinion was not necessary to
        reassure me in the matter of the Manufacturers&rsquo;
        Association&rsquo;s criticism. The judgment which is
        really important is that of one&rsquo;s own conscience.
        Mine tells me that, however imperfect our work
        may have been, however much there may be room
        for improvement, what we have done has not been
        inconsiderable, especially when the difficulties
        under which we have laboured are considered. I
        am confident that the broad lines of policy which
        we have followed are right, and that our work, as
        our knowledge of existing conditions increases,
        will be of more and more value to the working
        men of Canada and to the country generally.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I miss you very much in the office, but still
        more out of it. Indeed when you are away I
        realize how much we are together. However,
        Rex, I need not assure you that I am constantly
        with you in thought. Your life has grown into
        mine to such an extent that your hopes and aspirations
        are mine as well. Take care of yourself,
        my dear Rex, and whatever may be the outcome
        of your mission, I know that you will have done
        your duty. When you are in the mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span> think of one whose soul is also profoundly stirred
        by the message which great, glorious, beautiful
        Nature has for man.</p>
    <p> &ldquo;With much love,</p>
    <p class="center">&ldquo;Ever yours affectionately,</p>

    <p class="sign"> &ldquo;<i>Ottawa, Nov. 13, 1901.</i></p>
    <p class="pn">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Rex</span>:</p>
    <p>&ldquo;You must not take my official notes daily
        as a measure of my interest in your affairs here,
        your progress yonder, or your thoughtfulness in
        writing me such refreshing letters as those which
        you have written <i>en route</i>. And let me thank
        you for these letters, Rex. They take me with
        you as you go through that wildly grand country,
        the very thought of which makes the heart of a
        true Canadian bound with pride. The dating of
        your last, &lsquo;in the country of the foot-hills,&rsquo; makes
        me think how eagerly you must be looking forward,
        as you wrote, to the prospect of the mountains.
        Perhaps you were fortunate enough to see
        them in the stern glory of a winter sunset. These
        things, like great pictures and noble thoughts,
        leave a permanent impress upon one&rsquo;s life, and I
        rejoice that the path of duty has led you through
        so much that is beautiful and sublime.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>
    <p>&ldquo;But hold, I am probably several chapters behind
        your present thought and work, for by now
        you will be wrapped up in the affairs of a mining
        town, interested in its mushroom growth, its
        throbbing, ill-digested life, and in the main object
        of your mission, the strike.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is this very mission of yours which
        has set my mind so strongly of late upon the
        question of man&rsquo;s duty. This afternoon, Harry,
        Laschinger and I took a long walk in the frosty
        air,&mdash;for winter has gripped Ottawa hard, ice
        covers the ground, ponds are frozen and the sky
        is stern and gray, and I found myself driven to
        turn conversation along this line. Is it because
        the church has so far drifted from truth that it
        succeeds so little in making the life of Christ a
        reality among men? I thoroughly hold that once
        convince a man of a truth, and that truth, even
        despite him, will become an active potent factor
        in his life. How are men to be convinced? The
        church says do this, because authority says it is
        right so to do. But men do not do it. Why?
        Because men do not come to vital conclusions
        upon the strength of authority, especially when
        they have their own opinions regarding the channels
        through which the authority filters. Is it not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span> time that a different line should be followed?
        Tell men to do right because it is right to do
        right; because it is consonant with the law of
        their natures; because only by so doing will they
        realize themselves. And here we come to the
        great beauty, justice and potency of the appeal to
        the rule of law. Show a man that it is only by
        putting forth his best efforts towards what his best
        consciousness tells him to be right that he will
        make any progress satisfactory to his own nature,
        or in harmony with the eternal realities, and the
        shackles of petty ambitions fall from him. He
        becomes stronger and stronger. And in proportion
        as his own true strength increases, so will the
        appreciation of nature&rsquo;s laws and the character of
        Christ develop manly humility and a sense of
        duty to the world without him, a sense that his
        life is part of the lives of many others, as many
        as come within the almost unlimited sphere of his
        influence, and that he owes it to himself, as much
        as he owes it to them, that that influence shall
        also tend in the direction of perfection, the sweeping
        away of bitterness, passion, prejudice and
        viciousness in whatever form. Once bring home
        to a man the sense of personal duty in terms of
        inflexible and yet infinitely just law&mdash;law which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span> properly followed, makes for progress, if disobeyed,
        for confusion,&mdash;and you have put him on
        his feet with his face to his true goal in life.
        Herein, it seems to me, lies a reconciliation of
        the two injunctions: &lsquo;Bear ye one another&rsquo;s
        burdens,&rsquo; and &lsquo;bear your own burden.&rsquo; Do the
        latter, and you will find yourself doing the former,
        which is a good thing to do.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;All of this is simple, Rex, even rudimentary,
        but to-night it has a strong hold upon me, and, as
        I have not you here to talk to, I am laying it
        before your sympathetic eye, that is if you have
        patience for it. Out there where the country is
        just finding itself, where standards are few and
        hastily put together, men are apt to emphasize
        the importance of the <i>immediate</i> thing. Here in
        the East men try to get away from the truth by
        demanding &lsquo;of all the thousand nothings of the
        hour, their stupefying power.&rsquo; Both sides of the
        continent have perplexities and heartaches for the
        well-wisher of mankind. But, however distressing
        may be the rash radicalism of British Columbia,
        I doubt if its position is not relatively better than
        that of the indifferent East. For where there is
        manly force and rude contact with nature&mdash;in
        Carlyle&rsquo;s sense&mdash;there is apt to be more of a re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>sult
        where an appeal is made, as it must be in
        both cases, to the manliness of men, the true-heartedness
        of true hearts. The main difference,
        it seems to me, lies in this, that British Columbia
        requires the curb, and the East the spur. Both
        need light. And the man who would give it to
        them must have their confidence, so much have
        men come to associate the truth and its exponent.
        Confidence requires trust and faith; and these,
        to be lasting, must be based upon strength and
        honesty in the individual who would be the guide.
        Hence it behooves every man who would be of
        lasting service to his country to see that he, too,
        is clean.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;But I see I am going far afield again. I miss
        you, Rex, very much. The meaning of an individual
        is sometimes emphasized when the individual
        is absent from the associations which are
        eloquent of his individuality. The Canadian
        Manufacturers&rsquo; Association to the contrary notwithstanding,
        your work is neither superficial nor
        ephemeral. It is of the very essence of a force
        which is calculated to prove a strong lever in
        regulating the labour movement, and indeed other
        movements as well, in Canada. It is my happiness
        to be associated with you in that work. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span> think I comprehend its nature and its importance,
        immediate and even prospective, and I trust I
        may prove true to its demands and purpose.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;But I must get down to my night&rsquo;s work,
        Rex. The house is singularly quiet, without any
        movement in the adjoining room, but that does
        not excuse the sacrifice of opportunity.</p>
    <p> &ldquo;With best wishes and much love,</p>
    <p class="center">&ldquo;Affectionately yours,</p>
    <p class="sign">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Bert</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And nothing, not even the loss of life itself,
    did excuse, with Harper, &ldquo;the sacrifice
    of opportunity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harper was drowned on the sixth of December.
    Three days later, on the twenty-eighth
    anniversary of the day of his birth,
    they buried him on the crest of a hill over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>looking
    the village in which he was born.
    Thus does Destiny, linking the cradle with
